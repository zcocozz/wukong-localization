Sun Wukong,人，我保住了 ,My master-safe! 
Sun Wukong,经，我取到了,The scriptures-sound! 
Sun Wukong,俺老孙啥功名不要，只求回到这花果山终老，过过逍遥日子,"All I ever wanted was a life in my mountain, free from you, and your so-called merits. "
Sun Wukong,上面的天王老子信不过我，我懂,Those high above don't trust me. I understand that. 
Sun Wukong,让你小子带些虾兵蟹将过来虚张声势,And they send you and those knuckleheads...
Sun Wukong,又想唬我回去做神仙，我也懂,"to threaten me to obey and serve once more. Hmm, I understand that too. "
Sun Wukong,我不懂的是……,But what I don't understand is...
Sun Wukong,你他娘的杀我猴子猴孙,you bastards killing my kind!
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",蠢狗，放肆，还不退下 ,"Stay back, stupid dog! "
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",都记好喽，他不是只普通猴子，他是有功的猴子 ,Mark this. He's not just any monkey. He's a monkey of merit. 
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",是封过佛位的猴子,A monkey was made Buddha once. 
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",这里除了我，没人配与他单挑,None other than me can challenge him to a duel.
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",猢狲啊猢狲，我本不想与你这个手下败将再战一场,"Look, monkey, I don't make a habit of fighting someone I've bested before..."
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",这样罢，一会儿若是你败了，我带你回天庭,"Here's my offer. If you lose, I'll take you to the Celestial Court. "
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",他们，留在这里铲平花果山,They would stay and level your mountain. 
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",若是我输了，我定然不会罢休,"But if I lose, I shall certainly take revenge, "
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",他们，照样铲平花果山,and they will level your mountain nonetheless!
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",生灵涂炭呐，好歹也同僚一场，是真不想打,"How tragic would that be, huh? You were one of the Court; we don't need to resort to violence. "
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",要不你现在就跪下，认个错，这事儿就算过去了，如何？,"How about you bend the knees, admit the wrongs and we can put this behind us?"
Sun Wukong,这么多年了，除了那只猪头，就属你最会扯淡，最能逗老孙开心,"All these years, except for that pig, you're the one who talks the tallest tales. Good, I am entertained! "
Sun Wukong,杨兄弟，你放心,"Speaking of entertainment, "
Sun Wukong,待会儿我只拔下你额头上那颗眼睛尝尝鲜，其他两颗先给你留着,"wouldn't it be fun if I pluck your extra eye out for my snack, and allow you to keep the other two? "
Sun Wukong,我让你亲眼看看，我是怎么杀光天庭每一条狗的,Because I'd hate to let you miss how I'll slaughter each mongrel of the Court. 
Sun Wukong,这里的，上面的，还有刚刚那条黑的,"Those below, those above, and that black mutt of yours. "
Sun Wukong,溜撒点，一起上罢！,"Come at me, all of you!"
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",老天一再给你机会,"They gave you many chances,"
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",你这般不识抬举，算不算背恩忘情,yet you spurned each one. Such ingratitude!
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",斗战胜佛……,The Victorious Fighting Buddha...
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",你可知这长生不老的佛位，有多少人求而不得？,Have you any idea how many would give their everything for immortality?
Sun Wukong,长生不老……,Immortality... 
Sun Wukong,三界六道，不就毁在这四个字上？,"For that word, all realms and beings have ruined themselves."
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",泼猴，你受了天箓，本性未改,"The Celestial Court welcomed you, foul monkey, yet you remain untamed!"
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",今日谁也救不了,None shall save you now!
Sun Wukong,好兄长， 你的刀钝了？,"Dear brother, your edge needs honing."
Sun Wukong,正好给俺老孙挠个痒……,"Good, I was in need of a backscratcher!"
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",泼猴，吃吾一刃！,"Foul monkey, taste my axe!"
Sun Wukong,小外甥，这就是你说的单挑？,"Brat, you call that a duel?  "
Sun Wukong,天上阳光扎眼的很，有种再和你舅舅去山里会会,The glare up here is dazzling. Fight me in the woods if you have the guts.
The Old Monkey,这便是孙悟空的最后一个故事,"And so ends the last tale of Sun Wukong, "
The Old Monkey,他一生豪杰，平生最喜自由自在,a hero who treasured his freedom above all else. 
The Old Monkey,纵然得了正果金身，却还是受不得天条繁冗,"Buddhahood he attained, yes; but cumbersome, he found the Celestial Rules. "
The Old Monkey,一心想着回来这里，与咱共乐天真,For he yearned to come back and to revel in the simple joys with us. 
The Old Monkey,谁知他辞了佛位，欢喜还乡，有些人倒是越发放心不下,"Little did he know, his choice to forgo the life above only fueled their mistrust."
The Old Monkey,这块石头啊，在山里矗了不知多少时节,This stone has stood for countless days on the mountain. 
The Old Monkey,我打小听人说，齐天大圣的尸身，就藏在里面,"Since my youth, they said that his remains lie within it. "
The Old Monkey,他乃天产石猴，本有不生不灭的大神通,"Unbegotten, undying, such is the nature of a stone monkey. "
The Old Monkey,纵然不幸身死，但神魂没有完全消散,"Though his body was broken, his spirit endures. "
The Old Monkey,而是化为了六件灵物，各自逃遁，隐匿世间,"Into six relics he turned, and separately they escaped, choosing to stay hidden. "
The Old Monkey,这便是大圣六根的传说,Those are the Six Senses of the Great Sage. 
The Old Monkey,可惜数百年来，无人亲眼得见,Yet no one has ever seen them. Not in centuries.
The Old Monkey,我老了，走不完这四洲茫茫之地,"I'm old now. Venture through all the lands, I cannot. "
The Old Monkey,但你们之中，庶几会有天命所归,"Yet among you, there might be one who is destined, "
The Old Monkey,将他遗下的灵物一一寻遍,one that shall recover all his scattered relics. 
The Old Monkey,待灵物尽数回归花果山之日，或是大圣复生之时……,"And upon the return of the relics to Mount Huaguo, he may yet rise again..."
Wolf Swornsword,走走走，游游游,"On the go, bent the toe, "

Wolf Swornsword,诶，你看,"Here, you see? "
Wolf Swornsword,缘到福自有,What bliss my fate shows!
Wolf Scout,大哥真是有口福,Well well! Luck's around the corner.

Wolf Swornsword,这桃儿倒是识趣,This peach knew I needed a snack!
Wolf Swornsword,好个小猢狲,You sneaky rascal!

Wolf Swornsword,今日定叫你知道知道厉害！,I'll make sure you regret it!
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,不管来多少次,No matter how many times you come around.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,总是改不了这胡闹性子,"You are still as mischievous as ever, eh?"
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,发什么呆,What are you waiting for?
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,拔根毛来拜一拜,Pluck your hair and make an offer!
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,哎，等等！,Hey! Wait!
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,小神是黑风山的土地，在此候你多时,"I, the keeper of Black Wind Mountain, have long been waiting for your arrival."
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,像,His spitting image...
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,真像,I'd say.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,再往前走，就是观音禅院,Up ahead is Guanyin Temple.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,当年也是香火鼎盛,"Once, it was bustling with worshippers,"
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,只可惜那场大火……,before it was ruined by that fire...
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,后来，这禅院又被重建了,"Then, the temple was rebuilt. "
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,可人心若是烧没了,But what good is it to rebuild a temple...
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,修好一座破庙，又有什么用呢？,if the goodwill of men has been burnt to ashes.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,你不记得此地,You've forgotten this place. 
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,此地却是有些东西惦记着你,but they haven't forgotten you!
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,来者不善，小猴子自求多福！,That's a tough one. Good luck to you!
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,许久不用,"It's been a while, "
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,没承想这定身术倒还好使,but the Immobilize Spell still works like a charm!
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,既是花果山来的故人,"Since you hail from Mount Huaguo, "
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,教你一招也无妨,it won't hurt to teach you a handy trick.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,来，速速把手伸来！,"Now, here we go, give me your hand!"
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,写好了,There you go. 
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,日后遇到什么凶匪恶徒,"Should you come across any miscreants, "
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,只消用这手一指,"just point your finger at them,"
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,心里默念一声“定”,and release this spell. 
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,就能让对方动弹不得,"You'll be able to hold them in place, "
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,你也可喘息片刻,while giving yourself a breather.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,只是小老儿道行浅薄,"Sadly, mine is but a humble trick. "
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,这定身效果不消片刻就会失灵,Its power will wear off within a few short moments.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,遇到些夯货倒还好用,Though it's good enough against boneheads like this one. 
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,你权当是挣个傍身的手段罢,"Anyway, just consider it an ace up your sleeve."
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,如今这些小儿,The younguais these days... 
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,真是目无尊长！,have no manners!
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,别怕，用刚学的法术与他玩玩！,Fear not! Teach him a lesson with your new spell!
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,再不知深浅地这么往前硬闯,"Hey! Wait! You don't think you can just parade in, do you?"
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,只怕得吃大苦头,It's not that simple!
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,我且把你变为一只金蝉,Let me transform you into a golden cicada.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,你可顺着前面的火光,"So you may follow the fires ahead,"
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,探一探这山中的虚实,and scout this mountain unnoticed...
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,小庙还有诸多神奇妙用,"It might be humble, but my shrine is very versatile."
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,日后你自会明白,You'll get it soon enough.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,黑风山的后山重地，藏着不少秘密,"In the depths of Black Wind Mountain, there are secrets galore."
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,想四处探探的话,"The cicada form may help you explore,"
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,务必留神金蝉的存续时间,but be wary this form does not last forever.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,若是遇上穷途末路之处,"Should you find yourself lost, "
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,小神自会暗中提点,just follow my voice.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,放心去罢！,"Now, off you go!"
Guangzhi,来者何人,Who goes there?
Guangzhi,敢来此处扰我清修？,How dare you to interrupt my meditation...
Guangzhi,诶，又是只猴子？,"Hmmm...Another monkey, I see?"
Guangzhi,施主不如放下棍棒,"Why don't you lay down your weapon,"
Guangzhi,也同我学点佛法,and join me in Buddha's mercy?
Guangzhi,如何？,What say you?
Guangzhi,你……莫非就是大王说的那个……,You... Master spoke of you...
Guangzhi,天……命……人,The Destined... One.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,嘘！别出声,Shhh! Keep quiet!
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,小心惊动了那条大狗,You don't want to set off that beast.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,后院那厮是黑风怪的道友,In the backyard is Black Wind Guai's ally.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,自称灵虚子,Calls itself Lingxuzi.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,以你现在的道行，恐怕……,Considering your strength... I'd suggest you...
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,糟了！,"Oh, no!"
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,小猴子快逃，还来得及！,"Get away while you can, little monkey!"
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,你若进了这道门，便回不了头了！,"Once you pass that gate, there's no turning back!"
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,小瞧你了,You've surprised me.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,既然结果了它，不妨先把这里翻个底朝天,"Now that it's dead, you might as well take a good look around."
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,那黑风怪赏了凌虚子一颗金丹,A great pill the Black Wind Guai had gifted the wolf.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,若是寻到此物，就算没白来一遭,Finding it would be a deserving reward for that fight.
Guangmou,小僧法名广谋,This humble one's name is Guangmou.
Guangmou,若是今日死在你手,"Should my demise come by your hands,"
Guangmou,帮我带句话给师父,please pass this message to my master:
Guangmou,肉眼凡夫，求而不得神仙骨,"Searching for deity, mortals do aspire."
Guangmou,半荣半枯，几人知是长生路,"Craving immortality, yaoguais surely will conspire."
Guangmou,施主如此执于外物,My master is possession-obsessed.
Guangmou,与我那师父又有何分别,You are just like him...
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,广谋？,Guangmou?
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,广智？,Guangzhi?
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,小神想起来了！,I remember now!
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,当年怂恿金池长老放火烧死唐僧师徒的恶僧,The evil monks abetted Elder Jinchi to burn the Great Sage and Tang Monk alive...
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,正是他俩！,That's these two!
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,我道是这两人，都随那场火灰飞烟灭了,I thought they were already turned into ashes by that fire.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,谁晓得不但没死，还化成了一狼一蛇两只妖怪,Who would have thought they had turned into yaoguais?
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,小神有种不好的预感,I have an ominous feeling...
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,钟响之后，后山传来的怨气似乎更重了一些……,"After the bell rang, it seems as though the resentment in the depths of the mountain has grown."
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,算了算了，想那么多作甚,Forget it... Overthinking won't help.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,现在山里大大小小的妖精，都知道你闯进来了,Your presence has already made a mess in the mountain.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,干脆一鼓作气，把他们收拾干净罢！,Why not go ahead and take them out once and for all?
Shen Monkey,你你你，愣着干嘛？,"Hey, hey! What are you waiting for?"
Shen Monkey,快快快，帮你哥哥，速速乱棍打死,"Come, come! Help a big brother and give them a drubbing!"
Shen Monkey,小小蛇妖，不过尔尔,These snake guais are nothing to fear.
Shen Monkey,蛇胆用来泡酒，倒是清热解毒的佳品,"Snake gall steeped in drink, though, makes a fine tonic to flush malady."
Shen Monkey,来来来，小老弟，里面请，里面请,"Here, here, young friend! Be my guest inside!"
Shen Monkey,瞧瞧瞧，你这模样多半也是花果山来的猴子，我见得多了,"Well, well, I'd stake you're one more monkey from Mount Huaguo. I've met many of you."
Shen Monkey,论辈分你们都得叫我声祖宗,"By rank of birth, you all ought to call me forefather."
Shen Monkey,不过算了，谁让我被贬了呢,But I'm just an old monkey banished to the mortal world.
Shen Monkey,下界之时，拿了不少宝贝，你瞅瞅，可有心仪的？,"I brought troves down to this realm, though. Have a look if something catches your fancy."
Shen Monkey,小老弟切记，一分醉酒，十分醉德,"Remember, young friend: a sip makes one tipsy, many sips make you hammered."
Shen Monkey,管他玉液琼浆，羊酪椰醪，宽怀畅饮！,"Dew drops, honey brew, sheep curd, palm tipple. I drink all there is!"
Shen Monkey,有酒处处神仙府，无酒天阙如天牢,"Where there's drink, all is bliss. Without it, the highest court is a cage."
Whiteclad Noble,凤兮凤兮,"""Hailed bird, hailed bird!"""
Whiteclad Noble,何德之衰,"""What dimmed your shine?"""
Whiteclad Noble,往者不可谏,"""Past's grip, beyond our grasp."""
Whiteclad Noble,来者犹可追,"""The future, we may still clasp."""
Whiteclad Noble,小师父，天色已晚,"Late is the hour, young one...."
Whiteclad Noble,你来我这修身之地大开杀戒,... in which you choose to stain my tranquil abode.
Whiteclad Noble,到底是何居心啊？,"Pray tell, to what end do you seek?"
Whiteclad Noble,且慢！,Halt!
Whiteclad Noble,是大哥要我来此做个内应，这才假意听命于那熊罴守这后山要道,No ill will I bear. I'm merely my brother's eyes and ears. I feign my loyalty to guard this path on the bear's order!
Whiteclad Noble,知君命不偶，同病亦同忧,"""Your destiny's bleak and stark. In its grip, we share the mark. """
Whiteclad Noble,观音禅院是烧没了，可那长老的冤魂没有散,"The Guanyin Temple now lies in cinders, yet the Elder's soul endures."
Whiteclad Noble,贪根不拔，苦树常在,"""The root of greed ever fosters the stem of suffering. """
Whiteclad Noble,你真正想要的东西，忘了最好,Better to forget the things you truly seek.
Whiteclad Noble,那三口钟……你可都见过了？,The three bells... Have you seen them all?
Whiteclad Noble,旁人念念不忘的，也是你所求的吗……,"Do you, too, desire that which they ceaselessly hold dear?"
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,钟……？,The bells?
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,自那黑风怪回来后，山里便立起了三口洪钟，却不许旁人靠近,"Three bells were set in the mountain since the Black Wind Guai's return, yet no one is allowed to go near them."
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,莫非那三口钟，与当年的火烧禅院有关？,Maybe the bells have something to do with the temple's burning.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,此人所言不像假话，小猴子，你可暗自留心,"His words sound like truth to me, little monkey. Stay sharp and keep a lookout!"
Elder Jinchi,阿弥陀佛,Thank Amitabha!
Elder Jinchi,那三口洪钟终于响了,"Oh finally then, the three bells sang!"
Elder Jinchi,徒儿们，又有外面的老爷们过来了,Disciples come! I hear travelers approaching my temple!
Elder Jinchi,给我带新宝贝了！,Carrying new treasures!
Elder Jinchi,我看不见样貌,I cannot see you....
Elder Jinchi,但我能闻到那股臊味,but I recognize your odor!
Elder Jinchi,莫非是你？,It cannot be you?
Elder Jinchi,你回来了？,You are back?
Elder Jinchi,定是你把那袈裟藏起来了,It must be you who took that kasaya!
Elder Jinchi,快还给我！,Now give it back!
Elder Jinchi,我今年二百七十岁,Two hundred...and seventy years spent...
Elder Jinchi,空挣了几百件袈裟,Kasayas collected....by the hundreds...
Elder Jinchi,怎么得有他这一件？,Still one short...without his...
Elder Jinchi,不，不不,"No, no, no! Stop, stop, stop!"
Elder Jinchi,广智广谋,Guangzhi! Guangmou!
Elder Jinchi,那袈裟我不要了，不要了……,That kasaya... Leave it... Just leave it!
Elder Jinchi,你们别烧，都别烧了……,Stop the fire! Please stop...
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,辟火罩！,The Fireproof Mantle!
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,当年大圣从广目天王那里借来的神器，居然还在这里,The Great Sage borrowed it from Virupaksa. How did it end up here?
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,你想必是超度过那个人了,You must have freed that miserable soul.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,唉，缘起缘落,Such is his end...
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,只因多看一眼,A tragedy prologued by a single glance.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,天色不早，赶紧上山罢！,It's getting late. Let's hurry up the mountain!
Black Wind King,五百年了,Five hundred years.
Black Wind King,我重建了观音禅院,I have rebuilt the temple.
Black Wind King,规模比之前的更大,Now it's grander in scope.
Black Wind King,那些葬身火海的僧众 ,"All those monks consumed by the fire,"
Black Wind King,化为孤魂野鬼 ,"turned to wandering ghosts,"
Black Wind King,在这黑风山间游荡,roaming in Black Wind Mountain.
Black Wind King,是我！,"It was I,"
Black Wind King,亲手将他们超度,who granted them eternal repose!
Black Wind King,我甚至把那些经书残卷,I have even restored the charred scriptures...
Black Wind King, 一一复原,piece by piece!
Black Wind King,但我知道总有一天 ,But oh yes I always knew...
Black Wind King,你还是会找上门来！,one day you shall return!
Black Wind King,有点本事,You have some cheap tricks.
Black Wind King,有种跟我来山顶会会！,Meet me at the summit if you dare!
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,他这聚形散气之术,The spell he just cast...
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,看着花里胡哨,"may appear intricate,"
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,实则不难掌握,but it's not hard to learn.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,这黑风怪学艺不精,That black bear's expertise is lacking.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,去了趟南海也不见长进,Serving Guanyin didn't help him much.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,他刚才的几番变化,But what he left here...
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,遗留了不少元气在此,could surely help us!
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,正好小老儿收些来用！,Consider today your lucky day!
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,聚形散气，无痕无迹,"Focus and disperse, illusions traverse."
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,里面门道大得很,You still have a lot to learn.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,自己慢慢领悟罢,Give yourself the time you need.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,小猴子，前方山路凶险，紧要时莫忘了刚学的法术！,"Ahead is a treacherous path, young monkey. Don't forget the spell you just learned!"
Black Bear Guai,那家伙曾经对我说,"He once told me,"
Black Bear Guai,眼不见，心不乱寻常修为，,"""Out of sight, out of mind is a fool's task; """
Black Bear Guai,入一切相，破一切相，方得自在,"""seeing but seeing through is what wise men do""."
Black Bear Guai,可是他自己看到那些东西后,But didn't he turn mad...
Black Bear Guai,不也疯了吗？,"by what he saw, too?"
Black Bear Guai,小泼物有点手段,You cunning wretch...
Black Bear Guai,今日本大王先不与你纠缠！,I'll spare your sorry life for today!
Black Bear Guai,此番不同往昔,Fortune is no longer on your side.
Black Bear Guai,无人与你助力,No one will come to your aid.
Black Bear Guai,待我取走这宝贝,All I need is to take it elsewhere...
Black Bear Guai,哪里不能重建宝刹？,and rebuild everything anew!
Black Bear Guai,大圣,Great Sage!
Black Bear Guai,哦不，小圣,"Oh, pardon me, Young Sage!"
Black Bear Guai,小圣饶命！小圣饶命！,"Mercy, Young Sage! Have mercy!"
Black Bear Guai,我也是被那天庭胁迫,I was just a pawn of the Celestial Court.
Black Bear Guai,若非身不由己,"If given a choice,"
Black Bear Guai,好端端的谁敢对那闹天宫的瘟神动手,who'd dare to challenge the mighty Wrecker of the Celestial Palace?
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,这熊怪说的倒不假,His words ring true.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,借再多的胆子,"No matter how daring he was,"
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,他也绝计不敢自己谋害大圣,he had not the nerve to harm the Great Sage.
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,这幕后指使定然另有其人,There must be someone else pulling all the strings
Black Bear Guai,况且这玩意邪乎得很,Exactly! And this thing is eerie.
Black Bear Guai,得来后根本不知如何炼化,"I had no idea how to make use of its power,"
Black Bear Guai,只好高高供在上面,"except to enshrine it up there,"
Black Bear Guai,偶尔骗些小妖怪朝拜敛财而已,tricking lesser yaoguais into offerings.
Black Bear Guai,若小圣饶我这一次,"If you'd pardon me,"
Black Bear Guai,我自当回到南海负荆请罪,"I'll go back to Guanyin to atone for my actions,"
Black Bear Guai,重戴禁箍,and be put back on the Encaging Band.
Black Bear Guai,从此不再离开普陀半步！,You will never see me out there anymore!
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,别听他掰扯！,"Oh, ignore his nonsense!"
Keeper of Black Wind Mountain,小猴子，赶紧先把大圣遗物取回来看看,"Go now little monkey, go and retrieve the great sage's relic."
Black Bear Guai,师傅，徒弟还是想不明白,"Master, it still puzzles me."
Black Bear Guai,出家人尘缘已断，金海尽干,A monk's lust for gold should be quelled.
Black Bear Guai,长老他为何偏偏放不下一件衣裳？,Why does Elder Jinchi still cling to that one kasaya?
Guanyin,若不披上这件衣裳,"Bereft of that kasaya,"
Guanyin,众生又怎知我尘缘已断，金海尽干,"how shall they show the world their ties are cut, and their lust is quelled?"
Headless Monk,黄风岭，八百里，曾是关外富饶地,"Yellow Wind Ridge, a mighty ole' range, once buzzin' with joy and glee."
Headless Monk,一朝鼠患凭空起，乌烟瘴气渺人迹,"But the pesky rats took hold, a sudden unfold, turned it all barren and bleak."
Headless Monk,无父无君无法纪，为非作歹有天庇,"The King got denied, rules thrown aside, evil connived, runnin' wild and free."
Headless Monk,幸得大圣见佛力，邪风一时偃旌旗,"Wukong went to the Bodhisattva to plead, granting this land a moment o'peace."
Headless Monk,哪知不测奇祸起旦夕,"Yet before long, another disaster struck,"
Headless Monk,那黄毛孽畜再回籍,The cursed beast returned on a killin' spree
Headless Monk,凶犯不死好得意，福星横尸却成谜,"The hero, he lies there dead, with the truth hidden from ye and me..."
Headless Monk,小施主来此的目的，老衲多少猜到几许,"Reckon I got an idea why ye have come here, me friend."
Headless Monk,心急吃不着热面皮，暂且助你一臂之力,Haste makes waste. I'll lend ye a hand.
Headless Monk,小心上路，再落得一身窟窿可没人救,"Watch your step, eh? Get more shots and you'll be high and dry."
Headless Monk,血化风，沙化雨，无主的猫鼠儿串一气,"In a land o' bloodshed and chaos' sting, mice and rat mingle without a king."
Headless Monk,成败生死莫讲理，不强走那正道才有戏,"No logic in success or strife, the right path may be a different thing."
Headless Monk,好一个心狠手辣的泼赖猴,"Oh! Heartless monkey, vicious and vile!"
Headless Monk,可怜那鼠怪耗精地府走,Woe! Me heart pains for their death wail!
Headless Monk,眼见得父死子亡又生离愁,"Father and son, fate's bitter game,"
Headless Monk,老衲我有手无头空虚久,"Headless, I grieve all the same."
Headless Monk,普天之下,"Across all realms,"
Headless Monk,父子君臣纲纪，伦常规矩天理,"Fathers and sons, kings and folks,"
Headless Monk,哪个说了才算，哪个放任不管,"the former bonds the latter, that's how it goes."
Headless Monk,你瞧那鼠辈倒讲人情,"These rats have obeyed the rule,"
Headless Monk,可怎么就落得个子亡父逃尸骨寒,"But how come fate snatched the son, and the father flew?"
Headless Monk,世人都爱拼利害，偏偏破门敲不开,"People crave greatness, but the gate's held. The path to glory, a secret withheld."
Headless Monk,神风奇术蔽日月，三昧妙法障山海,His great Samadhi Wind sweeps the land. Veils the sky with its mighty command.
Headless Monk,要想见那黄毛鼠精，必须要得心腹口令,"To beat the yellow rat, tokens ye'll need. Get both from his henchmen who ye'll meet."

Headless Monk,金铁击石金无力，大圣天蓬遭虎欺,"The tiger deceived them, led them to attack a rock, But the rock stood firm, leaving hands sore and the tiger's mock."

Headless Monk,小施主筋骨清奇，正相应这铜头铁臂,This body of yours is perfect for the art of Rock Solid.

Two Head Rat,我王执迷不悟，如此下去，何谈复兴,"With a blinded king, we can never rise again."
Two Head Rat,须找到下落不明的三王子,We must find the missing prince.
Two Head Rat,三王子？算了算了，他最恨老鼠！,The Third Prince? But he's against rats! Remember?
Two Head Rat,我们现在这副样子，三王子认不出来，认不出来……,And look at us now. He won't even recognize us. Not one bit!
Two Head Rat,我王奉鼠，三王子便心生不满，远走他乡,"The King honored rats, that's why the Third Prince left."
Two Head Rat,曾有国人游历四方，说在西天佛国见过他,"Some claim to have seen him far away, somewhere in Buddhas' realm in the West."

King of Flowing Sands,不像人，不像牛羊，却跟咱们一般大小,"not from men, or livestock, but littered in the remains of our kin!"
King of Flowing Sands,这天杀的毛团，日后大王知道了定饶不了它！,"Curse that furry jackass! Oh, just wait... Wait until master hears about this!"

King of Flowing Sands,这鬼地方也有鲜肉送上门？,delivering itself all the way to this dump for our lunch!
King of Flowing Sands,贼猴子，难道你不知我国有敬鼠令么！,Wicked monkey! Have you not heard of the Reverence Edict here for mice?
King of Flowing Sands,想当初我们跟着大王何等辉煌,"How mighty we were, standing with Master."
King of Flowing Sands,可怜现在连只贼猴子都拿不下,"But now, we can't even best this vile monkey."
King of Flowing Sands,大王啊，不要闭关了！,"O my Master, quit your meditation, I pray!"
King of Flowing Sands,即帮我等降服巨虫，再帮我等降了这贼猴子罢！,"You helped us subdue that beetle. Now, aid us in crushing this filthy monkey!"
King of Flowing Sands,刁民！刁民！,Rabbles! Rabbles!
King of Flowing Sands,刁民造反啦！,Rabbles defying their king!
King of Flowing Sands,砸死你这刁民！,"I'll stone you to death, lowly rabble!"
Man-in-stone,不知道哪个妖孽用法力把我困在石头里了,Some bastard has got me trapped in this rock with his spell!
Man-in-stone,连带这岭上的石头也成了精,Even the rocks on the ridge have come to life!
Man-in-stone,那边的山洞里有只石精怪得很，它身上一定有些秘密,"In that cave, there's a rock guai lurkin', holdin' secrets, I bet!"
Man-in-stone,弄清了原委，我好脱身,"Should ye uncover the reason, I shall find me way out!"

Son of Tiger’s Acolyte,拨浪鼓，摇一摇,Let me hear my rattle-drum.
Son of Tiger’s Acolyte,你见过爹爹了？爹爹哪里去了？,Where is my pa? Did you see him?
Son of Tiger’s Acolyte,爹爹说，风沙散了，病就能好,"Pa told me, when the dust stops, my cough ends."
Son of Tiger’s Acolyte,一看你就是外乡人,I know you're not from around here.
Son of Tiger’s Acolyte,别皱着眉头，这里可好玩了,Don't frown like that. Our village is fun!
Son of Tiger’s Acolyte,有躲在石头里的老爷爷，有在村子里偷酒喝的猪,I know an old man in the stone and a piggy who steals all the drinks.

Yellow-Robed Squire,把酒仰问天，古今谁不死……,"""Raise thy cup, seek answers on high. Who defies death, 'neath every sky? """
Yellow-Robed Squire,不妙，误了正事……,"Ugh, I messed up my mission..."
Yellow-Robed Squire,去给咱找解酒的来……,Go find something to sober me up...
Yellow-Robed Squire,定风庄的酒，再来两坛,"Two more jars from Windrest, make it quick!"
Yellow-Robed Squire,神清气爽！,How refreshing!
Yellow-Robed Squire,是你把咱叫醒的？多谢,You woke me up? Thanks!
Yellow-Robed Squire,不过咱现在肚子空空，恕不奉陪,Enough with the chit-chat. My belly's growling.
Yellow-Robed Squire,咱现在得填饱肚子,I must quench this rumbling in my belly first.
Yellow-Robed Squire,都道卧虎寺内有肉吃，那可得去瞧瞧,"The Temple of Crouching Tiger, they say there's meat there. Worth a look!"
Yellow-Robed Squire,吃饱唱足才好做事，肚肠空空可是没戏,"The feast first, then the toil. Hunger brings no spoils!"
Yellow-Robed Squire,你这瘦鬼身子，也该多吃点，走走走，跟咱去卧虎寺,"You should eat more, skinny. Off we go! To the Temple of Crouching Tiger."
Yellow-Robed Squire,这些烂鼠肉食之若啮檗吞针,This putrid rat meat is insufferable.
Yellow-Robed Squire,气煞咱,It drives me mad!
Yellow-Robed Squire,你想法子给咱找点好东西尝尝如何？,"Help me score a tasty treat, will you?"
Yellow-Robed Squire,老夫馋那碧藕馋得紧，在此干早之地，可能寻到？,I've been craving a taste of that juicy Jade Lotus. Can you find me some in this barren land?
Yellow-Robed Squire,偶尔吃吃素，也未尝不可,I wouldn't mind some meatless meals from time to time.
Yellow-Robed Squire,事情有了些眉目,I have stumbled upon some interesting leads.
Yellow-Robed Squire,那黄金之国，真与这不毛之地有关,The Realm of Gold does hold a connection to this desolate land.
Yellow-Robed Squire,传说中黄金之国是太阳西沉落海之地，那里的人们以鼠为尊,"I hear the Realm of Gold is where the sun sets. There, they held rats above all others."
Yellow-Robed Squire,只是不知怎的，后来这个国家就消失了，很是奇怪,"And somehow, before we knew it, the realm was gone. Quite odd, that is."
Yellow-Robed Squire,造才咱尝了尝那些鼠精鼠怪，咂摸着像是还带点人味儿,I just tried those rat guais. They taste like men flesh.
Yellow-Robed Squire,那古国遗民并未尽亡，黄风怪与古国的神秘消殒恐怕脱不了干系……,Its people are not yet extinct. I suspect the Yellow Wind Guai had a role in their downfall.
Yellow-Robed Squire,来之前，大哥给我一枚金片，说是到时自有用处,"Our senior brother gave me a piece of gold. I'll need it here when the time's right, he said."
Yellow-Robed Squire,时候到了，咱这就回老地方试上一试,It's the right time now. I'm taking it to the right place to give it a try.
Yellow-Robed Squire,大哥给的金片，为何在你那里？,Where did you acquire my brother's gold piece?
Yellow-Robed Squire,拿来！,Give it here!
Yellow-Robed Squire,好身手！痛快！,What an excellent fight! The intensity!
Yellow-Robed Squire,如此甚好，与咱同赴古国如何！,This is good. You and I should explore that realm together!
Yellow-Robed Squire,今人不见古时月，今月曾经照古人,"Men in our time do not see the ancient moon, but this moon hath shone on men of yore."
Yellow-Robed Squire,你看，黄金之国也好，落日之国也罢，都已不复存在,"Behold! Be it the realm of sunset or the realm of gold, it's but an echo of the past."
Yellow-Robed Squire,传说这里的茫茫沙海之中，曾蛰伏着一只上古巨虫,Legends speak of an ancient colossal beetle in these sands.
Yellow-Robed Squire,这巨虫平日里沉睡地底，无踪可寻,"Whilst deep in slumber, it lay hidden beneath the earth's embrace."
Yellow-Robed Squire,一旦醒了便会钻出来吞噬人畜,"When awakened, it would devour all souls that crossed its path."
Yellow-Robed Squire,偏偏它外壳坚若磐石，寻常刀斧弓弩难以穿透,"Its shell, harder than stone, defied the strikes of common arms."
Yellow-Robed Squire,往来商旅不敢靠近，周边小国更是苦不堪言,"It struck fear into travelling merchants and wider, to neighboring realms."
Yellow-Robed Squire,适逢一只黄毛貂鼠下界途经此地，感应到那巨虫身上似有无上佛力,But a yellow-furred rat sensed the immense power emanating from the insect.
Yellow-Robed Squire,于是施法镇住巨虫，收为己用,He halted the beetle's havoc and harnessed it for his own ends.
Yellow-Robed Squire,小国国王大喜，将鼠妖奉为护国神圣,"Overjoyed, the king named the rat guai the Royal Sage,"
Yellow-Robed Squire,更为他建庙塑像，世代供奉,and built a shrine in his honor.
Yellow-Robed Squire,鼠妖图修炼方便，干脆留了下来,The bound beetle was a perfect source of power so the rat stayed.
Yellow-Robed Squire,后来，鼠妖神功初成，掳走了唐僧，与孙悟空激战于黄风岭……,He seized the Tang Monk using the new power and battled with Sun Wukong upon the Yellow Wind Ridge...
Yellow-Robed Squire,一时风沙蔽日，日月无光……,The guai's formidable winds veiled the vast expanse of the sky.
Yellow-Robed Squire,那鼠妖的神风着实厉害，若非灵吉菩萨出手，怕是真经难取,"Were it not for Bodhisattva Lingji, Tang Monk's quest for the scriptures would have failed."
Yellow-Robed Squire,只是……没了鼠妖坐镇，古国自是难逃覆灭的劫数,"Yet, stripped of the rat's protection, the kingdom was plunged into a state of ruin."
Yellow-Robed Squire,而原本水秀山青的黄风岭，也变成了今天这般模样……,The once lush Yellow Wind Ridge now lies a desolate wasteland...

Yellow Wind Sage,虎先锋败了？,You bested my vanguard?
Yellow Wind Sage,想必你有几分神通,Then you do indeed have skills.
Yellow Wind Sage,那妖怪身上不知有何法宝，与我相克,That yaoguai must have some vessel that counters me.
Yellow Wind Sage,三昧神风都不能伤他分毫,Even my Samadhi Wind can't hurt it.
Yellow Wind Sage,要引那妖怪出来，须得用擂鼓之法,There is only one way to draw out this yaoguai.
Yellow Wind Sage,我擂响大鼓，引出巨虫,I'll sound the drums and it'll come forward.
Yellow Wind Sage,若你愿前去，待时机一到，夺了他的法宝,"If you are willing, l ask you to seize its vessel at the right time."
Yellow Wind Sage,我便能施法降服此妖,"Then, the yaoguai will be mine."
Yellow Wind Sage,擂鼓之法本是这天尽头的百姓，为抵御太阳西沉入海的海沸之声而发明,"Here at the western end of the world, each day the sun sets and boils the sea."
Yellow Wind Sage,海水沸腾，声音之大，可以震杀城中小儿,The boiling hiss is sharp enough to ravage babies in their cradles.
Yellow Wind Sage,擂鼓之法解了此难，却又引来了妖怪,"The people sound drums to counter the impact, but the drums draw this yaoguai."
Yellow Wind Sage,它有法宝护身，我无开奈何,The vessel this yaoguai holds protects it from me.
Yellow Wind Sage,你既有胆来，恳请助我一臂之力,Your boldness in venturing here is clear. Aid me with this!
Yellow Wind Sage,那怪就在下方沙海之中，请务必助我降服此妖，救此地百姓,"It's right here beneath us in the sands. Together, we shall rid the people of this wretched yaoguai."
Yellow Wind Sage,满城百姓，感谢不尽！,"On the folk's behalf, I thank you!"
Yellow Wind Sage,有圣，就有盗,"Besides every sage, a villain resides."
Yellow Wind Sage,有高山， 就有深渊,"Beneath every mountain, an abyss lies."

Bodhisattva Lingji,还要师父的脑袋……,Ye even took yer master's head!
Bodhisattva Lingji,就为在这黄风谷底一时快活？,Just for a short reign over this barren valley?

Bodhisattva Lingji,也是这鼠妖的看管之人,the warden of this rat.
Bodhisattva Lingji,大圣殒后，六根不灭，散落到了世间,"After the Great Sage's passing, his Six Senses were scattered across the mortal realm."
Bodhisattva Lingji,这贼鼠私下寻得其中一根，因自身修为有限,"This thieving rat chanced upon one of them, yet hindered by his meager might,"
Bodhisattva Lingji,难以炼化，于是生了歹心……,"he could not absorb its power, thus he schemed with wicked intent..."

The Third Prince,是你啊……竟然还活着,"Oh, it's you. You're still alive?"
The Third Prince,还杀了我部下将领，打开了这扇门,And I see you've slain one of my captains and helped yourself to break in.
The Third Prince,我部下共有四将，皆乱了心智,"Four loyal captains. Now, four bewildered souls."

The Third Prince,这个于我已无用，你且收下罢,Take this. I don't need it anymore.
The Third Prince,该回家了……,Now I can go home...
Kang-Jin Star,元帅还是不肯归顺吗,"Admiral, why so stubborn?"
Kang-Jin Star,再忍一时三刻，怕是就要化为脓血了,"Keep at it, you could melt into blood and pus."
Zhu Bajie,好妹妹，里面凉快得很呐,"Darling come on, it's perfectly cool in here!"
Zhu Bajie,就等你进来与我一起双修了,"Join me inside for some yin-yang practice, will you?"
Kang-Jin Star,元帅说笑了,"Such humor, Admiral."
Kang-Jin Star,你若放下执念，我自然会劝师父放了你,"Let go of your stubbornness, and I could request Master to set you free."
Kang-Jin Star,到时便可同修大道,Then I'd be open to joining you.
Zhu Bajie,我可消受不起,"Oh, I don't deserve you."
Zhu Bajie,看来那老贼得了师兄的玩意，果然功力大涨,That old bastard has really made good use of Wukong's relic.
Zhu Bajie,连你这东天小官都被驯得服服帖帖,"Even you, a Celestial Courtier, bend to his will."
Zhu Bajie,不过听这动静，天命人已停了塔下的经筒,"Yet, my ears tell me that the Destined One has stopped the mani wheel."
Zhu Bajie,好妹妹，估着这金疙瘩要等不到你师父来开咯,Pity. Reckon it won't be your master who unlocks these metals eventually.
Kang-Jin Star,这金饶是祖师爷的法宝，小小天命人，如何破得了,"These Gold Cymbals are made by our Grandmaster, and you think a puny monkey can go beyond that?"
Kang-Jin Star,你……你唤醒了龟将？,You... you've roused Turtle General?
Kang-Jin Star,你怎知这下面是他？,How could you know he is here below?
Zhu Bajie,甚么蛇不蛇龟不龟的,"Turtle, snake, who cares?"
Zhu Bajie,刚刚闻到一股臊味,"I caught a whiff of monkey stench,"
Zhu Bajie,这味道好生亲切，忍不住敲锣迎接！,familiar enough for me to sound my welcome!
Kang-Jin Star,师父惜你赋性，饶你一命，让你在浮屠塔底清修,Master valued your talents. He kept you alive beneath the pagoda for your own good.
Kang-Jin Star,既不识相……,How ungrateful...
Kang-Jin Star,小西天的极乐之境，怕是与你无缘了,"Evidentally, you just don't deserve the ecstasy of the New west!"
Kang-Jin Star,师父果没说错，猴子最是冥顽……,"Master's right, monkeys are set in their ways."
Kang-Jin Star,倒也无妨，这金饶你休想打开！,Still though.... you'll never crack the Gold Cymbals!
Zhu Bajie,阿绵花屎呢，拖拖拉拉的！,What took you so long? Constipation?
Zhu Bajie,老猪我在里面都快腌硬了,I was nearly cooked alive in there!
Zhu Bajie,让开让开,Move it!
Zhu Bajie,我呸！,Bah!
Zhu Bajie,人不人鬼不鬼的婆娘,Blasted eyesore!
Zhu Bajie,不想想当年在天上，我几时拿正眼看过她,Wasn't even worth my second glance back in the Court.
Zhu Bajie,又是这副模样,"Ah, that same look again."
Zhu Bajie,毛脸毛眼，尖嘴缩腮，全仗着命大,A furry coat and a pinched face. Luck's all you've got.
Zhu Bajie,又是个哑巴，算了算了，正事要紧,"Great, another mute. Whatever, let's not dally."
Zhu Bajie,这只老龟，我倒有几分交情,"Now, the turtle and I have shared a few tales."
Zhu Bajie,这黄眉老怪不同别个妖王,That Yellowbrow is not like other foes.
Zhu Bajie,花果山那只老猢狲特地浼我来处理，生怕你中了他的算计,That old monkey from Mount Huaguo asked me to back you up here to save you from his ugly tricks.
Zhu Bajie,他和我说，只要凑齐六根，便能救活大师兄,"He told me that once we gathered all six relics, we could bring Wukong back."
Zhu Bajie,我且信他一回,Let's say I buy it for now.
Zhu Bajie,我先去叙叙旧，你四处查看一番,"I'll go and catch up with him first, you take a look around."
Zhu Bajie,龟老弟，这么多年被封在这鸟不拉屎的地方，苦了你了,"My old friend, you must have had it rough all these years in this shithole."
Zhu Bajie,你放心,"Rest easy,"
Zhu Bajie,等靠岸了，我一定上去先砸了那小破庙,"once we're ashore, I'll take down that blasted temple..."
Zhu Bajie,给你和蛇兄弟报仇,to avenge you and Brother Snake.
Zhu Bajie,稳点，稳点,"Easy there, easy."
Zhu Bajie,我懂,I hear you.
Zhu Bajie,这世道，活着，死了，都不如变回石头疙瘩,"Dead or alive, all suffer the same. Should be better off staying a stone."
Zhu Bajie,你啊，空涨了许大年纪，哽哽咽咽的成何体统,"Come on. Cut the weeps and whines, will you? You are too old for those."
Zhu Bajie,知道知道， 别哭了,"Yes, yes. Stop sobbing."
Zhu Bajie,老实在这候着，我去看看你那兄弟怎样了,"Stay here and wait, I'll check on your snake pal."
Zhu Bajie,这定是龟蛇二将中的蛇将了，竟已变为一具枯骨,"This must be the Snake General, now nothing but bare bones!"
Zhu Bajie,黄眉老怪的手段着实狠毒,"That Yellowbrow is surely cruel, I'll give him that."
Zhu Bajie,老兄，蛇将已入轮回，你莫再哭哭啼啼了,"Enough with the tears, Turtle. The Snake General has passed on."
Zhu Bajie,龟蛇二将竟被折磨成了这般模样,"The once mighty Generals, now tortured and shattered."
Zhu Bajie,他的泪滴可大有用处，这是他的答谢，你速去收下,His teardrop holds great power. Take it as his thanks to you.
Chen Loong,怪事，又一位老朋友，黄眉莫不是把老猪的旧友都抓来了？,One more familiar face! Are all my old friends in Yellowbrow's clutches now?
Chen Loong,非礼勿视，非礼勿听,Stop prying! This is not for your eyes!
Chen Loong,你这小儿，搅我雅兴！,"Young one, you have spoiled my joy!"
Zhu Bajie,老头儿，许久未见，你脾气见长啊!,"It's been a lifetime, old bones! Your temper's grown fiercer!"
Zhu Bajie,这些个神仙不好好在天上待着，来小西天做甚 ,Why are these Immortals in the New West instead of up above where they belong!
Chen Loong,我这小仙被贬下界，法力失了大半,"I was cast down to the mortal realm, my powers much diminished."
Chen Loong,别无所求，就想好好活着,I ask for nothing more than to live out my days peacefully.
Chen Loong,我死了算了，神仙做不成，又被你这猢狲欺负,"I might as well die! No chance at immortality, and forced to suffer your torment!"
Chen Loong,老夫横坚是动弹不得了,This old loong can hardly move a muscle as he is.
Chen Loong,非吃一颗戌狗老弟炼制的还魂丹药不行,Only one of Xu Dog's resurrection pills can save me now.
Chen Loong,你怎么还在这儿啊，老夫没剩几口气了,Why are you still here? This old loong's living on borrowed time.
Chen Loong,疼，疼哎,"Oh, the pain!"
Chen Loong,戌狗老弟好丹药,Xu Dog loves his medicinal arts.
Chen Loong,依他的脾性，准是又在哪个丹炉前摇扇子,"Given his nature, he's surely tending the furnace flames somewhere."
Xu Dog,不消说，定是那老头儿欺负你了,Your grim face alone speaks for that old loong's bullying.
Xu Dog,好汉莫怪罪，我两个是旧相识，他的脾气我再熟悉不过,"Pray, refrain from blaming him. His ill temper persists unaltered since the first day of our long acquaintance."
Xu Dog,这老龙神力仍在，就是馋我的丹了，拿去给他便是,"Regret not, for his power endures. His desire be but one more pill, gladly bestowed by me."
Chen Loong,孺子可教，孺子可教,I knew you could do it! The young may yet be taught.
Chen Loong,得此丹药，便有了开启那宝地的法力,"With this pill, I'll gain the strength to unseal that precious place."
Chen Loong,这画中胜境，乃是我等合力打造的世外桃源,The Painted Realm. A peaceful haven I built with my fellow deities.
Chen Loong,猴子既已归位，六丁六甲也当重聚了,"Now the monkey is in place, we should gather once more!"
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),啊啊妖怪，走开！走开走开！,No more yaoguai! Away! Away from me!
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),别过来，别过来,Don't... Don't get any closer!
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),打！打死这群妖怪！,Kill them! Kill the yaoguais!
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),你，你不会吃了我罢？,"Wait, you won't eat me, will you?"
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),小生，小生来此山中寻宝，不想遇见了妖怪,"I was... I was on a treasure hunt, but l ended up being the hunted."
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),幸得英雄搭救，待宝物到手，定与英雄同享,"I owe you my life, sir. I'll share the treasure with you once I find it."
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),都说此地乃西天佛国，为何尽是妖魔呢？,"Say, why is there nothing but yaoguais in this so-called Buddhas' realm?"
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),若又入险境，可否再访英雄帮助帮助?,"Can I look to you to save me again, sir, if they come back?"
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),稀奇古怪圆溜溜，青皮红肉黑骨头……,"Green without, round and sweet. Red within, a summer treat."
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),这冰天雪地的，该去那里找寻呢,Where can I find something like that in this frozen land?
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),火！,Fire!
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),英雄真是妙法，险些冻死在这雪岭,I would be dead if it weren't for you.
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),这便暖和多了,No more frost now.
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),听闻这山中有片瓜田，乃佛祖数百年前种下,I heard that Buddha planted watermelons here hundreds of years ago.
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),吃上一口，益寿延年,One bite grants prolonged life.
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),只是这天寒地冻的，我又无英雄这般法力傍身,"Yet, when the cold bites all around, without your powerful spells,"
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),找寻起来，实是艰难,there is no way I can find it.
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),此前有人瞧见一个胖头娃娃抱着西瓜跳下山崖,Someone once saw a chubby boy jump from the cliff with a watermelon in his arms.
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),那人跑到崖边探看，没一点人影，料想那娃定是摔死了,He rushed to the edge of the cliff but saw no movement down there. Seemed like a certain death.
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),却听得崖下传来孩子的笑声，一阵又一阵……,"But suddenly, he heard the boy laughing from beneath, on and on."
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),吓得那人屁滚尿流地逃了,"Bewildered, he fled from the cliff."
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),我猜疑这其中定然有千丝万缕的联系,This story may offer a clue for my treasure hunt.
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),莫非瓜田在那崖下？,Maybe the watermelons were planted under the cliff?
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),英雄不必在此守护,"Don't let me keep you, sir."
Traveler (Green-Capped Martialist),小生稍坐片刻，待身体回暖，便自行离去,I will leave by myself when I feel warm enough.
Green-Capped Martialist,三番两次试你，竟都是不分好歹的愚善,"Time and again, I tested you, and saw nothing but gullible goodness."
Green-Capped Martialist,大哥也有看走眼的时候,Our brother does misjudge as well.
Green-Capped Martialist,小小伎俩便能轻松骗来,It requires no effort to trick you.
Green-Capped Martialist,你根本做不成天命人，还是早登极乐罢,You will never be the Destined One. Let me help you end your sorry life! 
Green-Capped Martialist,莽夫罢了,"Foolhardy, nothing more."
Green-Capped Martialist,大哥交代的事情已了，来日再会！,I've done as our brother asked. Till we meet again!
Maitreya,果然有慧根,Your faith has led you here.
Maitreya,放松些，这里可没有假道场的繁絮叨叨，打打杀杀,Rest easy. You won't find those noisy chantings and pained screamings here.
Maitreya,好瓜，熟了,"A nice, ripe melon."
Maitreya,尝尝？,Want a bite?
Maitreya,可别瞧不上这瓜，当年孙悟空就是用它，诈了我那小童,It's better than you think. Sun Wukong used it to trick that disciple of mine.
Maitreya,来，近前来,Come... Come closer.
Maitreya,既然寻到这里，有一样他俩都不会的本事，我可传授与你,"Now you've found this place, I'll teach you a trick neither of them knows."
Maitreya,手,Your hand.
Maitreya,禁字法，不杀敌，只克已,Spell Binder. It hurts no foe but binds yourself.
Maitreya,妙用何在，你自会明白,You'll come to understand its use.
Maitreya,有位孙悟空的故人，来找过我，说想清静清静,"An old friend of Sun Wukong came to me, wanting some peace."
Maitreya,我便送他去了浮屠塔，你可曾拜会？,I led him to the Great Pagoda. Have you paid him a visit?
Maitreya,都说你是天命人,They say you are the Destined One.
Maitreya,可这命若由了天，还有什么意思呢,"But if destiny is set, what difference do our actions make?"
Zhu Bajie,爷爷我累了，去亭子里歇一歇,I need a rest. That pavilion looks like a good place.
Zhu Bajie,喂！你这鬼娃儿，又是哪冒出来的山精树鬼？,"Oi, kid! You look suspicious. What kind of yaoguai are you?"
Maitreya,嘘， 我在细细端详对面的大佛,Shh... I'm looking at that Buddha over there.
Maitreya,你看他的肚脐眼，有这么大,See his belly button? It's so big.
Maitreya,比我，比你，还大好几圈,"Me, and you, we look way smaller!"
Zhu Bajie,大佛？哪来的大佛？,Buddha? Where is it?
Maitreya,你看不见佛，因为你心里无佛,You see no Buddha because you think no Buddha.
Maitreya,无佛可拜，自然眼瞎,"No thought, no sight."
Zhu Bajie,我堂堂净坛使者，甚么大佛小佛没见过！,"I, the Sacred Gourmand, saw enough Buddhas before you were even born."
Zhu Bajie,你才眼瞎，不知先拜拜面前的活菩萨,"Foolish brat! You didn't see that coming, did you?"
Maitreya,心诚则缘到，缘到则佛现,"True hearts find their path, and the Buddha is on that path."
Maitreya,两位施主不妨再四处找找，好好拜拜,"Why not worship around with true hearts, for Buddhas may light your path."
Zhu Bajie,找个屁！,Worship my hoof!
Zhu Bajie,见庙就进，见佛就拜，不分真假黑白，那是我师傅,"Visit temples, kneel to figures, tell no black from white—that's my master!"
Zhu Bajie,我老猪平生最嫌这些表面功夫,I am fed up with all these skin-deep rites.
Maitreya,心不诚，山不开,"No true heart, the path is sealed."
Maitreya,心若诚，路自来,"With true heart, it's revealed."
Maitreya,出家人要逢庙烧香，遇佛拜佛,Visit each temple you encounter and worship every Buddha you see.
Maitreya,不然肉眼愚迷，难识活佛真形,Or the true face of Buddha will always remain elusive to your eyes.
Maitreya,莫急莫急，再四处看看,Why the rush? Try looking around.
Maitreya,欲要做佛事，须有敬佛心,"To see a Buddha, one must hold the Buddha in one's heart."
Zhu Bajie,老猪明白了,I get it now.
Zhu Bajie,那小和尚让四处找找，是让我们拜四次哩！,"""For Buddhas,"" that boy said... Ah! There must be four Buddhas to worship!"
Zhu Bajie,疯泼和尚，忒没道理！,Loony monk. Can't reason with him!
Zhu Bajie,后生，做个样子便好,"Just go through the motions, boy."
Zhu Bajie,那小和尚故弄玄虚，谁知真假,Who knows if it's true or not? That little monk was speaking riddles.
Zhu Bajie,当年过小西天,"Back when we journeyed to the New West,"
Zhu Bajie,便是因为师父他老人家以为到了灵山，见佛便拜，被黄眉捉了,Our master took it for Mount Lingshan. He visited and kneeled to every figure until Yellowbrow captured him.
Zhu Bajie,老猪可不上当,I'm not my master.
Zhu Bajie,什么动静！,What's that sound?
Zhu Bajie,定又是那小和尚耍把戏，拜什么拜，回去瞧瞧！,That little monk's up to his tricks once more. Worship my hoof! Let's go back!
Zhu Bajie,小胖和尚，能拜的全拜了，路呢？,"Chubby one, we've done the rites. Where's the path?"
Maitreya,路？路不一直在那里吗？,The path? Isn't it always there?
Zhu Bajie,你这鼓着肚皮的秃头小儿，敢唬我老猪！,"Don't you trick me, you bald, potbellied brat!"
Zhu Bajie,全是光溜溜的山，哪来的路！,All I'm seeing are mountains. No path at all!
Maitreya,他，有慧根,He sees wisely with faith.
Maitreya,你，心不诚,You are daft without it.
Zhu Bajie,诚你个奶奶！,Cut your nonsense!
Zhu Bajie,你莫不是那老贼变的，专来作弄人哩！,"You must be that trickster himself, fooling us all along!"
Zhu Bajie,吃我一钯！,Take my rake!
Maitreya,不拜就不拜，这般气急败坏,Why so rude? I didn't force you to kneel.
Maitreya,修养还不如身边小辈，羞是不羞？,Throwing a tantrum at this age? Shame on you!
Zhu Bajie,气煞老猪！,You brat!
Zhu Bajie,此路不通，爷爷我拱也拱出一条路来！ ,Save your stupid path. I'll burrow one myself!
Zhu Bajie,你且先行一步，我们在山顶汇合,You go on first. I'll meet you at the summit.
Non-White,死了一个妖猴， 又来一个妖猴,"One monkey dead, and another shows up."
Non-White,等剥了你这张脸，我也去当个天命人玩玩,The face of the Destined One? It will fit me just as well.
Non-White,好戏开场！,The real show starts now!
Fox Guai,官人且留步听我诉说,"Kind sir, pause your steps and heed my story."
Fox Guai,我本是山中修炼的狐妖，一心想成人,I was a fox guai who practiced to become one of the humans.
Fox Guai,谁料那日出门觅食，中了猎户埋下的陷阱,"One day, I was foraging for food and found myself caught in a hunter's trap."
Fox Guai,朦胧中见一书生前来，将我救下，带回家中养伤,A young scholar saved me and kept me in his home to let me heal.
Fox Guai,我动弹不得，心中却满是感激,"I couldn't move, yet my heart swelled with gratitude."
Fox Guai,原想待身体康健，便助他求取功名，以报救命之恩,I thought l could aid him in his career in return for saving my life.
Fox Guai,没承想，那书生南柯一梦，梦醒后将我残杀，留下孤魂不散,"Little did I foresee that, following a dream, he would take my life. My soul lingered, yet he left without a trace."
Fox Guai,我苦苦寻觅，才知他遁入空门，就在小雷音寺中,"I sought tirelessly, only to find he had become a monk in the New Thunderclap Temple."
Fox Guai,恳求官人，取我毛发，化身前往，见他一见，解我心中困苦,"I beg you, sir, to take my fur and wear my form. Confront him and calm my sorrowful heart."
Fox Guai,我知他藏在寺中偏殿，有劳官人，带我去见他,"He's hiding in the side hall of the temple. Kind sir, will you lead me to him?"
Non-Void,随自妄情种种计度，到底哪个才是真我，谁能知道？,"""Entangled in the web of all deceptions of the heart."" Who knows which thread in the net of my thoughts marks me true?"
Non-Void,此乃念佛斋戒之地，施主满身杀气，不妨坐下与老衲诵诵经,"In a place for chanting and peace, you reek of blood. Sit, and seek solace in the scriptures with me."
Non-Void,你我皆戴罪之人，人生漫漫，许多事不得不为,"We both misdeeds, things we had to do. Life demands us acts we’d rather not. "
Non-Void,老衲已悟彻红尘，余生只求在此殿内，诵经打坐，圆赎旧孽,"I've seen and severed the illusions of life. Now, I devote my existence to the scriptures for redemption."
Non-Void,施主，念经千遍易，知行合一难,It is as easy to recite as it is difficult to embody.
Non-Void,莫如老衲，到了这般岁数，还在悔不当初……,Let not the years lead you to lament as they have led me.
Non-Void,一念起万法生，一念灭万缘寂,"A thought springs, a world blooms; a thought ceases, all bonds break."
Non-Void,什么是对？什么是错？,What is right and what is wrong?
Non-Void,杀生有罪，可若是为了大道，不得不杀呢？,"To kill is foul. But for a noble cause, can it be justified?"
Non-Void,眼根受色，耳分别声，鼻嗅诸香，舌嗜于味,"""The eyes are lured by sight, ears by sound, nose by odor, and tongue by taste."""
Non-Void,所有身根，贪受诸触，意根分别，一切诸法,"""Every sense is ensnared by contact, yet the mind, based on the perception of all, differs from all."""
Non-Void,六情诸根，各各自缘，诸尘境界，不行他缘,"""All the six of them, tied to its kind, amidst the mortal world, are unswayed by each other. """
Non-Void,你，你，你是人是鬼？,A g-ghost? Weren't you dead already?
Non-Void,这么多年，我日日为你诵经，可你还是要索我性命么？,"For years, I've prayed you'd find peace. Still, you come to take my life in penance against yours."
Non-Void,你又岂会知我动手时，是何等心痛……,You wouldn't understand my agony when I took your life...
Non-Void,你既怨毒未消，我佛慈悲，便再超度你一回！,The Buddha sees no such vengeance. I shall usher you to the beyond once more!
Non-Void,哪怕遁入空门，也无法解脱……,"Nothing, not even the scriptures, can free me from this chain."
Non-Void,妖就是妖……无可救药……,The nature of yaoguais... is beyond remedy
Non-Void,冤有头，债有主,I've brought this upon myself.
Fox Guai,世人总说，人妖殊途,They say mortals and yaoguais walk different paths.
Fox Guai,再见到他，我才知道,But it's after seeing him again that I understood...
Fox Guai,怕妖的人，比妖更可怕,Those who fear yaoguais are fouler than what they fear.
Maitreya (Yellowbrow),好得很，好得很,How delightful!
Maitreya (Yellowbrow),它还记得你的味道,It still recalls your scent.
Maitreya (Yellowbrow),那猴儿活着的时候，只知四处求人，哭哭啼啼,"When that monkey was alive, he was all about weeping and begging for help."
Maitreya (Yellowbrow),死了还祸及子孙， 引得你们一个个送上门来,"Now, even in death, he led all you younglings right to me."
Maitreya (Yellowbrow),我这搭包儿，都快装不下了,This sack of mine can barely fit you all!
Maitreya (Yellowbrow),亢金龙，你法性已通,"Kang-Jin Loong, now that you are ready,"
Maitreya (Yellowbrow),出来帮为师试试他的成色,go and weigh up this one for your master.
Maitreya (Yellowbrow),看看这只猴子，是否够格做我的弟子,See if this monkey merits a place amongst my disciples.
Maitreya (Yellowbrow),入了此番轮回，就别想再轻易涅槃,"You have chosen your way. This time, there will be no easy way out!"
Yellowbrow,很久以前，我与金蝉子还是同门,"Ages ago, Jinchanzi and I were peers."
Yellowbrow,他是个认真的人,"Ever questing with good will, he was."
Yellowbrow,看不得灵山从来祥光瑞霭，山下却遭着苦困天灾,His nature made him question the supremacy of us beyond mortal woe and grief.
Yellowbrow,他说，凡诸众生，皆有慧根,He deemed all souls could be akin to us.
Yellowbrow,何以只有你我高高在上，其他人就只配磕头烧香,"""Why then do we tower, whilst others merely kneel and offer?"" He asked."
Yellowbrow,我说，因为他们不如你我,"I told him, the others are less than us."
Yellowbrow,后来，他犯了大错，重入轮回,His misstep cast him back into the endless cycle.
Yellowbrow,又收了几个徒弟,"Reborn, he drew three disciples."
Yellowbrow,可结果如何？,But what did they change?
Yellowbrow,徒弟死的死，逃的逃，连他自己也躲了起来,"One ended up a corpse, others fugitives. He too took to the shadows."
Yellowbrow,要我说，这些去取经的，都是废物,Pathetic. Those journeyers have misplaced their worship.
Yellowbrow,信甚么狗屁如来，不如我自己来,"Why bet on the Sutra, when one oneself can be a Buddha?"
Yellowbrow,既见未来，为何不拜？,Kneel before the Buddha of the Future!
Yellowbrow,顽固不化！,Obstinate fool!
Yellowbrow,本座这搭包正是为迷途之人准备,My sack awaits misguided souls like you.
Yellowbrow,你且进去悟上一悟！,Enter within and find enlightenment!
Zhu Bajie,你这夯货，也被那老贼抓到了？,Idiot! That trickster caught you too?
Zhu Bajie,这搭包儿比以前邪门多了，竟养出了此等利害妖物,"This wicked sack is much more vicious than before, nurturing such evilness!"
Zhu Bajie,估摸老贼借了大师兄的道行，把这破袋子又缝补了一番,Yellowbrow must have woven Wukong's strength into it. That bastard!
Zhu Bajie,一起上，先杀出去再说！,"Join me, let's fight our way out!"
Yellowbrow,还记得盂兰会上，世尊说过,I remember what the Buddha said at the Ullambana.
Yellowbrow,众生之苦，多因不守戒律，放情纵欲,"""All beings suffer as they heed not the precepts and indulge."""
Yellowbrow,要我说，放屁,I say: nonsense!
Yellowbrow,不杀生，仇恨永无止息,"Thou shalt kill, lest feuds instill."
Yellowbrow,不偷盗，强弱如我何异,"Thou shalt snatch, a fair play in a fair match."
Yellowbrow,不邪淫，一切有情皆孽,"Thou shalt lust, before all loves turn into dust."
Yellowbrow,不妄语，梦幻泡影空虚,"Thou shalt boast, for prestige and legacy it doth host."
Yellowbrow,不馋酒，忧怖涨落无常,"Thou shalt drink, and drenched unease shall sink."
Yellowbrow,不耽乐，芳华刹那而已,"Thou shalt revel, prime year shan't be spent to settle."
Yellowbrow,不贪眠，苦苦不得解脱,"Thou shalt dream, to reach in bleak void the sole gleam."
Yellowbrow,不纵欲，诸行了无生趣,"Thou shalt indulge, or life is but a scourge!"
Yellowbrow,万法皆空，唯因果不空,"All dharma is emptiness, but karma alone is not."
Yellowbrow,杀罢，杀罢！,Kill it! Do it!
Yellowbrow,对，就是这样，这才是你,"Yes, just like that, that's who you are!"
Zhu Bajie,小侄子，撑住！莫丢了神智！,"Keep your wits, boy! Don't get swayed!"
Yellowbrow,来，我让你杀得更畅快些！,"Here, let me quench your thirst for blood!"
Yellowbrow,诸行无常，诸相迷障,All conditioned things are impermanent and lead astray.
Yellowbrow,拿起屠刀，魔亦成佛！,"Be a butcher, then be a Buddha!"
Yellowbrow,以彼之身，施彼之道,"To retaliate in kind, you must be of that kind."
Yellowbrow,因果循环，报应不爽,"Now, you have introduced your karma in this cycle."
Yellowbrow,佛者，觉也,Buddhahood. Enlightenment.
Yellowbrow,你有觉心，定能成佛,Such enlightenment surely would grant you Buddhahood!
Yellowbrow,我有弟子三千，信众无数,"Three thousand heed my words, countless more revere my name."
Yellowbrow,皆为你准备，任你杀戮,They are all yours to have your fill of carnage.
Yellowbrow,六道众生谁无杀心？,"In the Six Paths, all souls harbor the urge to kill!"
Yellowbrow,何况天也杀人，地也杀人！,Even the sky and earth take lives!
Yellowbrow,你恶业深重，从一地狱历一地狱,Misdeeds heap upon your head as you find no escape in your suffering.
Yellowbrow,最后的涅槃便由我来助你罢,An ultimate nirvana I shall grant you gladly.
Yellowbrow,我……我早就看穿了你的下场,I saw how this would end for you long ago.
Yellowbrow,只要你还在为他人而战，迟早，也会死在他人手上,"Keep fighting for others, and in time, you shall fall by their hands."
Yellowbrow,我黄眉，只为自己,"I, Yellowbrow, fight solely for myself."
Yellowbrow,我没输……,I haven't lost...
Yellowbrow,我不会输……,I will not lose!
Yellowbrow,只要，只要再用一次那猴子的宝贝……,If only... I could wield that monkey's relic just once more...
Maitreya,这孽畜早先拐了我的宝贝下界,This rogue stole my Seedsack and fled here.
Maitreya,又借大圣之力，把我那后天袋儿变成了销魂夺魄的邪宝,"With Wukong's relic, he made it a soul-snatching vessel."
Maitreya,还化作我模样，假我之名诓来了许多旧仇，一心逞能报复,He also took my look and my name to trick his old foes into vengeance...
Zhu Bajie,大肚皮，我早该猜到是你！,You potbelly! I should've figured out it was you!
Maitreya,恕罪恕罪,Forgive my little deception.
Zhu Bajie,拐你一次，我信,Stolen once? I buy it.
Zhu Bajie,拐你两次，猪都不信！,Stolen twice? I doubt it!
Maitreya,我也不信，谁知这孽畜胆子这么大,Your doubt is fair. I shouldn't have underestimated his nerve.
Maitreya,我本要亲自收他，不料两位施主先到,"I meant to subdue him myself, but you two were swifter."
Maitreya,悟能你自是福大命大，而他年纪轻轻竟如此了得,"Fortune favors you, Bajie. But I see great potential in this young one"
Maitreya,这回或许……没看错人,He might just be... the right monkey.
Zhu Bajie,莫讲这些不帮衬的话,Enough of this empty talk.
Zhu Bajie,你那黄眉小儿失足淹死事小,I don't care if Yellowbrow drowns in the lake.
Zhu Bajie,大师兄的东西若是丢了，再找寻起来就难了,We can't have Wukong's relic sink with him!
Maitreya,你那九齿钉钯，且借我用用,"For that. Pray, lend me that rake of yours."
Jinchanzi,师兄此番下界，倒是去了好久,"You tarried in the mortal world for a good while, didn't you?"
Jinchanzi,说人话,Speak clearly.
Yellowbrow,这一回，我又赢了，金蝉子,"Once again, I proved it to you, Jinchanzi."
Jinchanzi,祸乱人心，倒果为因,"You chose a means to an end, not to a proof."
Jinchanzi,师兄如此执着输赢，可笑，可悲,You sow chaos in hearts just for the sake of winning. How absurd and pathetic.
Yellowbrow,若不能赢，还证什么因果人心,"Heh, if not for winning, why debate over means and ends?"
Non-Able,杀无赦,Kill without mercy!
Zhu Bajie,这断是个庙宇庵院，不打紧，进去瞧瞧,"It is a temple, no doubt. It won't hurt to peek inside."
Zhu Bajie,冰天雪地的，老猪孔儿都要冻住了!,The frost is biting hard. Even my rump is frozen solid!
Yin Tiger,闲话少题，我没兴趣,"Spare me your prattle, it bores me."
Yin Tiger,既然来了，我便帮你把那身破铜烂铁换换,"Since you're here, the scrap you're hauling can stay no more."
Yin Tiger,刀打好了，手痒得很，正愁没人来试,"Edge sharpened, arm restless. I was looking for someone to test it."
Yin Tiger,话说前头，我这刀铜浇铁铸,"Mark me, this blade is cast from the best metal."
Yin Tiger,擦着碰着，概不负责,Don't blame me if you hurt yourself.
Yin Tiger,废铁一块，不称我的武艺！,This scrap is unfit for my skill!
Yin Tiger,送你了！,It's yours now!
Yin Tiger,我再打一把就是,I'll just forge another.
Yin Tiger,一身破烂，难怪登门,What rags and tatters. No wonder you're at my door.
Yin Tiger,这才像个模样，不送！,Now you seem a proper sort. Be on your way!
Zhu Bajie,后生小辈，你可知那黄眉的来历？,"Young one, did you ever hear the story of Yellowbrow?"
Zhu Bajie,他原是东来佛祖弥勒面前司磬的一个童儿,"He used to be a measly altar boy to Maitreya in the East,"
Zhu Bajie,偷了弥勒宝贝，下界成精,stole his master's vessel to gain great power in the mortal realm.
Zhu Bajie,我们取经时路过小西天，黄眉假设小雷音,"When we journeyed to the New West and his New Thunderclap Temple,"
Zhu Bajie,师傅不知好歹，进门便拜，中了算计,our masterstrolled in and knelt —right into a trap.
Zhu Bajie,那黄眉老怪想打死我们师徒，自己去取经,Yellowbrow tried to slaughter us all and take on the journey in our stead.
Zhu Bajie,过了这些年月，这一点他倒是没变,"That's never changed, even after all these years."
Zhu Bajie,大师兄当年跟老猪一样，被困在金铙里,"Wukong got trapped in the Gold Cymbals then, just as I did."
Zhu Bajie,是亢金龙将自己的角钻进去救他出来,He was saved when Kang-Jin Loong broke the Cymbals with her antler.
Zhu Bajie,如今竟成了黄眉老怪的手下，怪哉,To think that she has sided with Yellowbrow himself. How odd!
Zhu Bajie,莫非是那孽畜又得了什么能迷人心窍的宝贝？,"You don't think that he's gotten his hands on some mind-twisting vessels, do you?"
Zhu Bajie,说到宝贝，黄眉老怪手上最厉害的宝贝当属那后天袋！,"Speaking of which, the most powerful thing Yellowbrow has should be the Seedsack!"
Zhu Bajie,天上的二十八星宿，北方真武大帝手下的龟蛇二将,"The celestial deities above, the Turtle and Snake Generals under Xuanwu…"
Zhu Bajie,还有国师王菩萨派来的小张太子和四大神将,"And the Third Prince with his Four Captains, sent by the Bodhisattva Guoshiwang."
Zhu Bajie,那破袋一张口，没一个逃得脱,"Once that wicked sack opened up, they were all devoured."
Zhu Bajie,大师兄没了法子，正凄惨呢，他师父弥勒就来了,"Just as Wukong was losing his wits, Maitreya himself appeared."
Zhu Bajie,你说巧不巧，偏偏是走投无路的时候，这胖和尚正好现身了,What were the chances? That pot-bellied monk came right as we were all out of options.
Zhu Bajie,主子一到，黄眉自是威风不起来了,"With his master present, Yellowbrow soon met his defeat."
Zhu Bajie,可要我说，他根本没服气，一直记恨着大师兄坏了他的前程,But I don't think he ever truly gave up. He's always had it in for Wukong for wrecking his plans.
Yaoguai 1,哥啊，这么好的差事交了我们，真是大造化,"My friend, we've struck gold with this task, haven't we?"
Yaoguai 2,大个屁！,Gold my ass!
Yaoguai 2,这一路挑担磨肩，骨头都累折了！,My bones are cracking from lugging this load!
Yaoguai 1,你只快些走吧，休要误了我吃酒,Step it up! I gotta catch that feast on time.
Yaoguai 1,我闻得，那妖婆有些个怪癖,Hear me out. They say that hag has her quirky ways.
Yaoguai 1,八节四时都要进补，每次进补必要成亲,"Each season, she'd wed a mate, then devour him."
Yaoguai 1,有次夫人来此贺喜，挑了面宝镜作礼,"Once, our Lady brought her a wedding gift: a mirror..."
Yaoguai 1,名为“照骨镜”,the Past-Echo.
Yaoguai 2,且慢,Wait...
Yaoguai 2,照骨镜……,The Past-Echo...
Yaoguai 2,我记得夫人时常念叨，言语间好生可惜哩,"The Lady often speaks of it with regrets, I wonder why..."
Yaoguai 1,你听我说完后话,"Let me finish, will you?"
Yaoguai 1,那妖婆拿镜子一照，竟失了神，转身就把镜子扔了,"The hag got the mirror and looked into it. And for no reason at all, she threw it away!"
Yaoguai 1,夫人因此受了闷气，便不再亲自走动了,That soured our Lady's mood. She stopped visiting since then.
Zhu Bajie,叨咕个没完,Jibbering and jabbering.
Zhu Bajie,老子一路上觉都睡不安稳,Couldn't even catch a wink of sleep this whole time.
Yaoguai 1,谁！谁在里面？,What? Who's in there?
Yaoguai 2,好大胆，巫山的贺礼也敢动！,How dare you spoil the gifts from Mount Wushan!
Zhu Bajie,这年头，躲在哪里都没个清静,No place to find peace these days.
Zhu Bajie,哪里来的女菩萨，快下来说话,"Hey lovely, why don't you come down and join us?"
Zhu Bajie,这就走了？害羞什么……,Leaving so soon? Why the shyness?
Zhu Bajie,前面似是个有人烟的去处，瞧一瞧？,Looks like there's a dwelling ahead. Care to take a quick peek?
Zhu Bajie,这鬼地方哪里还有人住，只剩些不济事的妖怪变着法子欺我们,"Who'd live in this forsaken place? None but spineless guais, fooling about."
Zhu Bajie,唉，这里还和从前一样，一点没变……,This place still looks the same. The past clings here.
Zhu Bajie,小猴子！我未曾说完呐！,You restless monkey! I was talking here!
Zhu Bajie,此处门路打开，必有埋伏,A wide road ahead. An ambush all but certain.
Zhu Bajie,莫要猴急,Hold your monkeys.
Zhu Bajie,让叔叔也帮你一帮,Let me fix you up a little.
Servant,二位远劳，里头正排筵席，快请进来饮几杯薄酒罢,"Welcome, good sirs! The feast is all set. Please come in and be our guests!"
The Second Sister,哟，二位贵客，怎来得这般迟？,"My! Gentlemen, you're fashionably late."
Zhu Bajie,你们家夫人，这次又没来吗？,Is your Lady not joining us again this time?
Zhu Bajie,夫人碍于身份，不便在下界露面,Our Lady prefers not to be seen in the lower realm.
Zhu Bajie,但她心里一直记挂着各位，特差小的送来这份薄礼,But she's been thinking of you all and sent this small token.
Zhu Bajie,夫人说了，盼仙姑早日康复，早日上天一叙,She hopes your Lady will recover soon and pay her a visit up there.
The Second Sister,夫人未来，实是可惜,It's a pity she didn't come.
The Second Sister,我们可是备了一出好戏要唱，专意等了这许久哩,Or she would certainly enjoy a splendid show we've prepared for her.
The Second Sister,而今……,"But now,"
The Second Sister,礼被偷了，人被杀了,"the gift's gone, and blood's been shed."
The Second Sister,不如……,I say...
The Second Sister,拿你两个顶缸罢！,You two should take the fall!
Zhu Bajie,我们不过是办事的下人，奶奶这是扯什么笑话？,"We're just servants, Madam. What's the jest?"
The Second Sister,猪……八……戒…,Zhu Bajie!
The Second Sister,我知你生得丑，怕见人,I know you find your look embarrassing.
The Second Sister,但也不用要顶着另一张猪脸哄我母亲罢？,But why hide from my mother with another pig face?
Zhu Bajie,没眼色,Rude girl!
Zhu Bajie,我老猪一心向佛，你母亲也不知哪位，且得等着,"Don't you know I'm a pious Buddhist? Give me your mother's name, and I'll check my list."
The Second Sister,好薄情的人！,You heartless ass!
The Second Sister,当年你在这岭上杀人放火，毁她清誉,"After you ruined her House and her reputation,"
The Second Sister,如今却都不记得了？,you're telling me you don't remember her?
Zhu Bajie,清誉？,Reputation?
Zhu Bajie,都做野妖精了，还有脸提什么清誉,Yaoguais care about reputation?!
Zhu Bajie,,All she cared about was lust!
Zhu Bajie,我说呢，原来你就是那蜘蛛精的小辈,"Now I know, you're one of her spiderlings, aren't you?"
Zhu Bajie,罢了罢了,"Well, well."
Zhu Bajie,叫我一声好叔叔，老猪给你几分面子，去那破洞里见见故人,"Your rudeness is forgiven. Show some respect, maybe I'll kindly pay your mother a visit."
The Second Sister,你乐意去也好，不乐意去也罢,"Visit or not, I'm afraid,"
The Second Sister,可不由你了！,that is not your call!
Zhu Bajie,晦气！,Curse it!
Zhu Bajie,你们这些昆虫，披了人皮，穿了人衣，也只会这等阴损勾当！,Bugs are bugs. Wearing human skin can't change your gross nature.
The Second Sister,是是是,"Yeah, sure."
The Second Sister,哪比得上你天蓬元帅光明正大,"We are so low compared to you, a glorious Admiral of the Court."
The Second Sister,那一位的尸身，我估摸着还没凉透呢,Ain't the last monkey still fresh in his grave?
The Second Sister,你这就又找了只新猴子拜作师兄了？,"And here you are, another monkey's sidekick."
Zhu Bajie,放你娘的屁！,Cut your bullshit!
Zhu Bajie,教你母亲早早出来求饶,"Get your mother to beg for mercy,"
Zhu Bajie,叔叔我念你年少无知，留你一条贱命,and maybe I'll spare your foolish life!
The Second Sister,实话与你说，东西就在盘丝洞里,"Truth is, the thing you seek is right here in the hollow."
The Second Sister,若是怕了，就赶紧逃罢,Flee now if you're too scared to come in.
Zhu Bajie,你儿子便怕！,Scared my hoof!
Zhu Bajie,这破洞今日我一次给它筑平,I'll destroy this rotten hole right now! 
Zhu Bajie,看你们一窝再去哪里藏！,Let's see where else you'd build your lair!
The Fourth Sister,听说里头藏着不得了的宝贝,I heard there's a great treasure hidden within.
The Fourth Sister,你模样这么伶俐，不妨进去寻寻,You seem smart. Why don't you take a chance inside?
The Fourth Sister,一群老不死的，符还挺厉害……,Blast this talisman! Those old rascals...
The Fourth Sister,这么快就能上蹦下跳了？,"On your feet already, are you?"
The Fourth Sister,若不想惹祸上身，这里的事你最好少管,Best keep clear of this mess. It's for your own good.
The Fourth Sister,趁早追上那只猪要紧,Go find the pig before it's too late.
The Fourth Sister,路我帮你铺好了,I've laid your path for you.
The Fourth Sister,救人易，救己难,But where will my path be?
The Fourth Sister,后面咱们就各凭本事罢,"From now on, we're both on our own."
The Fourth Sister,臭猴子,"Tell me,"
The Fourth Sister,你说……,"monkey,"
The Fourth Sister,这山岭外的世界,what's it like out there...
The Fourth Sister,究竟是什么样的？,beyond these mountains?
Yaoguai,大喜！大喜！,Big day! Big day!
The Second Sister,闭嘴！,Shut it!
The Second Sister,好蠢的东西，快些走！,Stupid thing. Faster!
The Third Sister,快来快来，他们到了！,"Hurry, hurry! They're here!"
The Fifth Sister,又不是三姐姐你成亲，这么着急做什么？,"So excited about the wedding, been dreaming about yours?"
The Third Sister,叫你编排我，今天我就收拾收拾你这小蹄子,"You little brat, dare to tease me! Come here!"
The Fifth Sister,好姐姐就饶了我罢,Stop it! I take it back!
The Fifth Sister,来了来了,"Hey, look! "
The Fifth Sister,新郎官来了！,The groom is here!
The Second Sister,我来迟了，妹妹们久等,"Apologies for keeping you waiting, sisters."
The Fifth Sister,我道母亲日思夜想的，是个什么俊俏郎君,Wow. Is he really the one Mother's been expecting?
The Fifth Sister,怎么生得这般憨丑,I thought he would look better...
The Fifth Sister,嘴脸是有些腌臜……,He's not much to look at...
The Fifth Sister,不过母亲喜欢就好,But as long as Mother is happy...
The Second Sister,丑是丑，听说以前倒还有些本事,"Not much of a looker, but quite a fighter, though."
The Second Sister,为了抓他，母亲的家传宝贝都用上了,Had to use Mother's ancestral vessel to take him down.
The Second Sister,可是费了姥姥劲儿了,Still aching.
The Fourth Sister,二姐姐真是勤谨,Aren't you diligent?
The Fourth Sister,捉到好东西,Such a rare catch...
The Fourth Sister,也不先让妹妹们尝尝,Why not let us sisters have it first?
The Second Sister,妹妹好大的气性,Think before you talk.
The Second Sister,母亲心心念念要嫁的人,This is the one Mother is set on.
The Second Sister,少根指头,"One scratch,"
The Second Sister,咱们都没好果子吃,and none of us would like the results.
The Fourth Sister,嫁了他又有什么用,What would this marriage change?
The Fourth Sister,我们还不是一辈子守在这鬼地方,"We are bound to this ill place, one generation after another."
The Fourth Sister,连你也不消停,Even you like this farce?
The Fourth Sister,想看,"Go,"
The Fourth Sister,就去前头看,go ahead and watch!
The First Sister,我说妹妹们,"Sisters,"
The First Sister,这还没开始行礼,the feast is yet to start.
The First Sister,你们就急着要闹喜堂了？,Don't tell me you're drunk already.
The Second Sister,不过是母亲修炼用的精元,Right. He's nothing but Mother's meal.
The Second Sister,我们哪，别操那没用的心,No need to make a big fuss over him.
The Second Sister,姐姐,"Here,"
The Second Sister,人我就交给你,he is all yours.
The First Sister,一路辛苦了,You've done great.
The Second Sister,姐姐……,Wait...
The Second Sister,母亲是老糊涂了,"Mother has grown soft with age,"
The Second Sister,妹妹们又不晓得事,and the girls are too young to know better.
The Second Sister,难道你也看不出来吗？,But can't you see it's all wrong?
The First Sister,你就当心疼心疼母亲,"Yes, but try to think from her position."
The First Sister,也是我们做儿女的，尽一次本分,We're her children. This is what we do.
The Second Sister,我何尝不心疼她,But I am on her side!
The Second Sister,她数十年的病根儿一直好不了,For decades she's been tortured by her wound
The Second Sister,正是拜这蠢物所赐,all thanks to this dumb thing!
The Second Sister,不恨就罢了，还这般作践自己,And yet she still wants to marry him?
The Second Sister,我……,No...
The Second Sister,我是演不下去,I can't do this anymore.
The First Sister,有些事情，不看对错美丑,Love is not about forgiving or getting even.
The First Sister,更不论强弱输赢,It is never a fair game.
The First Sister,都是机缘巧线编织的宿命,It's about two souls woven together by fate.
The Second Sister,姐姐……,But I...
The First Sister,你我当时都未出生,Neither of us was born then.
The First Sister,不曾见母亲用过的情,We never witnessed her past.
The First Sister,自然也参不透她今日的痴心,That's why we can't understand her obsession today.
The Second Sister,师伯那边……,Have you told Uncle...
The First Sister,走一步，看一步罢,Let's worry about that later.
The First Sister,借来的福分,Though her joy is borrowed...
The First Sister,能多享一日，也是好的,it's still joy before it's returned.
The First Sister,你，随我来,"You, come with me."
The First Sister,前面便是母亲的兰房了,Ahead is Mother's chamber.
The First Sister,这里有几句话，要叮嘱你,"Now, listen carefully for your own good."
The First Sister,母亲平日里都是好的,Mother is usually nice.
The First Sister,唯有吃饭时只爱独享,"Only, she prefers to dine alone."
The First Sister,千万别去沾惹她,You wouldn't want to disturb her.
The First Sister,还有,"And,"
The First Sister,别细看她的脸,"don't look at her in the face,"
The First Sister,尤其是眼睛,especially her eyes.
The Second Sister,姐姐，不能再耽搁了,"Hurry, we are running out of time."
The First Sister,我的话，你可要细细记住了,"My words, keep them in mind."
The Second Sister,快去，别误了时辰,Go. There's no time to waste.
Violet Spider,哥哥……,Bajie...
Violet Spider,你让妾身等得好苦,"I have been waiting for so, so long."
Violet Spider,天上果然不是人过的日子,Years up there haven't been kind to you...
Violet Spider,能回来就好,But you're with me now.
Violet Spider,姑娘们,Girls!
Violet Spider,排宴！,Let the feast begin!
Zhu Bajie,什么东西？,What on earth?
Zhu Bajie,一夜风流而已，竟要老猪的命来偿,"It was one merry night, and now she wants to take my life?"
Zhu Bajie,你倒是跟得紧，难道没了我老猪就办不成事吗,Following me like a shadow... Can't you do anything without me?
Zhu Bajie,脓包一个，别拖累你爷爷,Nitwit! Spare me this burden.
Zhu Bajie,奶奶的，都被你这小儿看见了，想笑话俺老猪？,"Darn it! Did you see all of that? You think I'm a bad joke, don't you?"
Zhu Bajie,疼疼疼！,That hurts!
Zhu Bajie,你莫管我，快滚！,Keep off. Leave me alone!
Zhu Bajie,弼马温，你不是死了么！,Filthy monkey! Aren't you dead already?
Zhu Bajie,这一切，都是你害的！,You're the one who ruined it all!
Zhu Bajie,老猪偏要在此过快活日子，休想再带走我,"This time, I'm staying here. You won't make me leave again!"
Zhu Bajie,咱老夫老妻的，何必翻那旧账,Why dredge up the past? Aren't we here now?
Zhu Bajie,你莫不是忘了，当年猴子留我下来灭口，是谁最后没舍得对你下手,Don't you remember how I spared your life when he asked me to clean up the rest of your sisters?
Violet Spider,我没忘,I do remember...
Violet Spider,但我更忘不了的是,And more than that...
Violet Spider,你们走后，我如何靠着姐姐们的肉身骨血才挺了过来,I even remember how I survived on my sisters' flesh after you left! 
Zhu Bajie,这仇不能全赖我们，要怪就怪你师兄,That's not all on us. The culprit is that centipede!
Zhu Bajie,是他把唐僧肉看得比你们姐妹的命要紧,All would have lived if he didn't weigh my master's flesh over your lives.
Violet Spider,师兄……是一时糊涂,Yes... he was blinded by greed.
Violet Spider,事后他悔恨交加，做了许多补偿,But he has repented and made his compensation.
Violet Spider,甚至……不惜用那东西替我续命,He even offered that thing to sustain my life.
Violet Spider,不然……我怎能撑到今日见你,"Otherwise, I'd 'never' live to see you today."
Zhu Bajie,好妹妹，你说的当真？,"My dear, is that true?"
Zhu Bajie,那东西，如今在你手上？,That thing is in your hands?
Violet Spider,哥哥,Unbelievable...
Violet Spider,到了此刻,"Even now,"
Violet Spider,你心里惦记的,in your heart...
Violet Spider,还是那只猴子,the monkey still comes first.
Zhu Bajie,什么猴子,The monkey?
Zhu Bajie,胡说,Nah...
Zhu Bajie,臭猴子哪有你标志,"For me, beauty always comes first!"
Violet Spider,再多说些我爱听的,"Good, carry on with these nice words."
Violet Spider,待我听快活了,"Once I'm satisfied,"
Violet Spider,兴许大发慈悲，告诉你那东西在何处,"I might lift my finger, and tell you where to find it."
Zhu Bajie,你这恶妇，有胆去泉边照照,You wicked hag! Can't you see your old face?
Zhu Bajie,都这般岁数了，还念些情情爱爱,Still obsessed with all this lovey dovey crap at this age.
Zhu Bajie,当真可笑！,Ridiculous!
Violet Spider,我困在这洞中,"Everyday trapped in this hollow,"
Violet Spider,日夜等你,"I missed and dreamed,"
Violet Spider,时时想你,waiting for the day...
Violet Spider,想着同房后立刻吃了你,to eat you right after we mate!
Violet Spider,治好我这病根,So I can heal...
Zhu Bajie,要吃便吃,Then eat!
Zhu Bajie,搞这一出拜堂敬酒，弄些个恶心虚头,Could've saved me from your stupid ceremony and wows.
Zhu Bajie,发什么夹脑风,What a farce!
Zhu Bajie,呸！,Pah!
Violet Spider,吃不下去……,My appetite is lost...
Violet Spider,不单是为你,"Not just for you,"
Violet Spider,更是为她 ,but also for her.
Zhu Bajie,这小女娃又黑又丑，鬼知道是谁的孽种！,Hideous! Hideous spider! Who fathered such a thing?
Zhu Bajie,你今日这般下场，与我毫无干系,Your fate today has nothing to do with me!
Zhu Bajie,我只恨自己当时太心慈手软！,"I had my mercy misplaced, that's all!"
Zhu Bajie,你怎么才来，我险些就死了！,What took you so long? I almost died!
Zhu Bajie,快快降了这妖婆，放我下来！,Now go beat this hag and get me down!
Violet Spider,快，去叫姐姐们过来,"Go, call your sisters."
Violet Spider,我此生,Monkeys...
Violet Spider,最恨猴子,The bane of my life.
Violet Spider,回回都是你们坏我好事,Why do you always have to ruin my plans?
Violet Spider,我究竟,In what way...
Violet Spider,哪里不如这些猴子,am l any less than monkeys?
Violet Spider,既然你这么喜欢猴子,"This monkey that you love,"
Violet Spider,我便剖了他的心,"I'll chop his heart,"
Violet Spider,挖了他的肝,"slice his liver,"
Violet Spider,与你一起尝尝！,and make you eat them!
Zhu Bajie,莫管我，快追上去，取回师兄的东西要紧！,Go after her. She has the relic.
Zhu Bajie,你快逃命，我自有办法！,Go!I can take care of myself.
Violet Spider,师兄……,Please...
Violet Spider,师兄，救我！,You must save me!
Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,既教你设了局，又与你法宝相助，怎就败了？,So... Both my trap and my vessel failed. But how?
Violet Spider,真见了他，我……,"When I saw him, I..."
Violet Spider,我下不去手,I just couldn't.
Violet Spider,后来天命人赶到，我打斗不过,The Destined One then arrived and bested me.
Violet Spider,洞里已被那猴子搅得翻天覆地,Now the monkey has ransacked our hollow.
Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,区区一只猴子，也忒无礼,A mere monkey showing such disrespect.
Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,你旧伤未好,"Your wound was recovering,"
Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,又被他打新伤,but now it's getting worse.
Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,放心，我替你打点！,Fear not. I'll deal with him!
Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,师妹,But before that...
Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,我的那样东西……,That thing of mine.
Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,可还在你身上？,Do you still have it?
Violet Spider,还在……,I do...
Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,师妹……,Very well...
Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,你虽样样不济，能把天命人引来这里,"Despite all your failures, you led the Destined One here."
Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,也算功德一件,I should reward you for that.
Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,但我借你的东西,"But the thing I gave you,"
Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,得先还回来！,now I must have it back!
Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,尔等小辈，如何能明白我的苦心,You girls are far too young to comprehend my design.
Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,只要再吞噬掉天命人的其余根器,"This, along with those relics inside him,"
Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,我便可不再受昆仑摆布,shall free me of Kunlun's reign.
Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,师妹，你的仇，我自然会报,"Rest assured, darling. I'll avenge you..."
Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,你苦了一辈子，安心去罢,"Now, let go of your misery and rest in peace."
Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,师祖下来救我……,"Come down, Grandmaster. I need you..."
The Second Sister,母亲！,Mother! 
Violet Spider,你还是和那时一样……,You haven't changed a bit...
Violet Spider,笨啊……,You fool...
The Second Sister,母亲！母亲！,Mother! Mother!
Commander Beetle,来取我性命？,You're after my life?
Commander Beetle,好！,Good!
Commander Beetle,不活了，出不去！,I'd rather die! There's no way out!
Commander Beetle,别愣着，速速上前，了结我罢,No more delays. Come close and finish me!
Commander Beetle,此洞无法逃脱，求你，杀了我,"There's no leaving this cave. Please, end me now."
Commander Beetle,终于，摆脱了……,At last... I am free....
Venom Daoist,一窍通，百窍通，今番也该换我飞升了,"Know thyself, know thy foe. In this way, I may meet my brother's wish."
Venom Daoist,修炼多日，八手功成,"Days of practice, eight arms of mightiness!"
Venom Daoist,你，终于来了,You're here at last.
Venom Daoist,天命人,The Destined One.
Venom Daoist,郎君有令，先与我试试身手,"By my brother's words, I will first test your worth."
Venom Daoist,你这狂贼休要得意,"Hold your smirk, you audacious monkey!"
Venom Daoist,待我堪破神机，再来与你讨账！,We'll settle our scores when I reach my full mastery!
Venom Daoist,我舍身入卵，为了什么？,I stepped into the sack for nothing but your sake!
Venom Daoist,你不谢我倒罢了，还断了我的手,"I'd appreciate a ""thank you"", but you gave me torn arms!"
Venom Daoist,就只好砍了你的，与我作赔！,"Now, in compensation, I'll claim yours!"
Venom Daoist,明白了……入卵飞升？,I see now...There's never ascension from those sacks.
Venom Daoist,无用的肢节，去了！,"Worthless limbs, be gone!"
Venom Daoist,是我上了那老道士的当，刚才的赌斗不作数,That old Daoist fooled me. My challenge was a delusion! Forget it.
Venom Daoist,想知如何克那魔君，就与我堂堂正正打一场！,Face me in a fair fight. You shall learn to best that corruption.
Venom Daoist,那根针……,Find the needle...
Venom Daoist,去紫云山找……,On Purple Cloud Mountain...
Snake Lady,夫君啊夫君，只怪奴家没有本事，无法与你报仇,"Husband, oh dear husband, my powerlessness grieves me so."
Snake Lady,只能在此哭告几声，望哪个过山的好心人，替我寻回你的尸首,"All I can do is weep here, hoping that a kind passer-by might find your remains."
Snake Lady,小师傅，妾身失仪了,"Your master, please forgive my impropriety."
Snake Lady,我本是个未亡人，来此祭悼亡夫，你莫怪罪,"I am but a widow, here to mourn my late husband. Show some kindness and excuse my manners."
Snake Lady,我与夫君本住在山顶的庄子里,We lived in peace in our mountaintop home.
Snake Lady,忽地一日，不知哪处杀来的一伙虫妖，定要强占此地,"But out of nowhere, wicked insects swarmed the place."
Snake Lady,庄子里人死的死，逃的逃、独留了我一个……,They occupied our village. I was the lone survivor...
Snake Lady,我原想回那庄子里寻些亡夫的遗物,"I intended to retrieve my late husband's keepsakes,"
Snake Lady,可那伙虫妖中有个领头的，号毒敌大王,"but the guais' leader, the Scorpionlord,"
Snake Lady,他的倒马毒甚是厉害，现下我一点成算也没了……,has discouraged all my attempts with his Deathsting...
Snake Lady,你也要去后头的山里？,"Young master, are you heading up the mountain?"
Snake Lady,那林间俱是些放毒的妖魔，你若擅入，必是有去无回,"Venomous yaoguais have infested the forest ahead. Take caution, or you may never make it back alive."
Snake Lady,切记多备些解毒的草药，莫要逞强……,"Remember to carry enough herbs with you, in case you find yourself poisoned."
The Sorpionlord,今朝有酒今朝醉，莫管门前是与非……,"In today's wine, I steep; let outside quarrels keep..."
The Sorpionlord,晦气，晦气啊！,"Woe, woe is me!"
The Sorpionlord,那等天克我族的祸害，不乘机痛快杀了，还偏让老子这里护着,"The chance to kill that bane of our kind is there! Yet here I am, forced to protect it!"
The Sorpionlord,走走走，别碍着我喝闷酒,Get lost! Don't disturb my drink.
The Sorpionlord,看你那副痨病鬼的模样，爷爷甩两钩子，你就死了，留着性命不好吗?,"How about a quick death with my stinger, you taut-faced monkey? Now leave while you can!"
The Sorpionlord,你别在这里晃荡，若是碰坏了老子的酒坛，有你好看,"Quit your dawdling, will you? One scratch on my jars, just one, and you'll be a dead monkey!"
The Sorpionlord,大胆！,The nerve!
The Sorpionlord,你这毛怪，我意欲放你，你却定要与我为难，自寻死路!,"You fur face! I meant to let you pass, but you chose to ruin my day! Now, face your doom!"
Daoist Mi,此等隐僻之处，许久未见过生人了,It's been long since any soul has trodden these hidden bounds.
Daoist Mi,小居士，你尖嘴缩腮，肌瘦面黄,"Hail, young master. Your face is gaunt, complexion sallow."
Daoist Mi,一副痨病鬼模样，莫不是也中了虫毒？,Both remind me of the venom's touch. Has the worm also beset you?
Daoist Mi,这谷内生有一种异虫，名琴螂,An oddity thrives here—the Amourworm.
Daoist Mi,生食其卵，可功力大增,Consuming its eggs grants great power.
Daoist Mi,只是那幼虫一旦孵化，便将五脏六腑啃食殆尽，空留一具不死的躯壳,"Yet once the larvae hatch, they devour your insides, leaving an undying husk."
Daoist Mi,我这些师兄师弟，各个都不信邪，贪功冒进，见着便吃,"My fellow disciples, hungry for power, consumed those eggs."
Daoist Mi,如今……多半药石无医了,And now... most are beyond remedy.
Daoist Mi,小居士，你若有心，便代我了结他们,"Young master, if you will, end their suffering in my stead."
Daoist Mi,同门一场，我下不去手,They were my fellows. I can't.
Daoist Mi,他们的尸身内，或还存有完好的新卵,Their lifeless bodies might still bear eggs unhatched.
Daoist Mi,顺道寻来给我，我也好找出破解之法,"Bring those eggs to me, and perhaps I can find a cure."
Daoist Mi,好！好！好！正是它,Splendid! This is it!
Daoist Mi,这般妖物，诡状异形，我得带回观内好生琢磨一番,"Vile and evil it is, hence I must bring it back for thorough study."
Daoist Mi,小居士，你我相识一场，也是难得,"Young master, in our brief acquaintance you were kind enough to do me a favor."
Daoist Mi,不如再帮我一回，将猴头留下，我好与师父交差,Why not extend your kindness by leaving your head with me? That would please my master greatly!
Daoist Mi,这般能耐……正好正好,A strong foe... Just what I need.
Daoist Mi,由你来做我锐变飞升的头份血食，再好不过,You shall be my initial feast to power my metamorphosis ascension.
Snake Lady,这些凡夫俗子，不自量力,These impudent mortals have overreached themselves.
Snake Lady,此番下场，都是咎由自取,Their demise was of their own creation.
Snake Lady,你不一样，这天地间的毒物，轻易要不了你的性命,But you - you are special. What poisoned them only strengthens you.
Snake Lady,这东西好生收着，善加运用，妙处无穷,Keep it close and wield it wisely. You'll see its potential.
Snake Lady,快去救他罢，困在那里，想必生不如死,"Go, release him. Being trapped there is a torment worse than death."
Snake Lady,从小看他长大，我下不去手……,I've watched him grow up; I cannot bring myself to do it...
Snake Lady,这些年未得相见，你竟被他们害成了这副模样,"All these years apart, and they've marred you like this."
Snake Lady,我自黎山而来，在此调查谷中之事,I journeyed from Mount Li to delve into the mysteries of this valley.
Snake Lady,我并非有意瞒你，确实有些难处,I didn't mean to hold this back from you. It was because I had to.
Snake Lady,我同他母亲相识一场，下不去手，这才引你来此,I stayed my hand for my ties to his mother. That's why I called upon you.
Snake Lady,我道此物早已落入那多目怪手中，竟被你寻得了,But how did you get this? I thought it was with the Hundred-Eyed Guai.
Snake Lady,或许这就是机缘罢,This...may well be the design of destiny itself.
Snake Lady,既然如此，我便帮你将此物回复神力，权作我的答谢之意了,I shall help you and restore its power. Consider this as my token of gratitude.
Snake Lady,不过是几缕天上垂下的丝线,A few strings dangling from the sky.
Snake Lady,连它通向何处，是福是祸也不知道,No one knows whether they lead to weal or woe.
Snake Lady,为何……都争着往上爬呢？,Why does everyone vie to scale them?
Crane Immortal,住手，且饶他一命,Stop! Spare his life.
Crane Immortal,你这泼猴，都第几世了，还是这般不通人情,"Foul monkey. No matter how many times you reincarnate, you're still blind to the ways of this world."
Crane Immortal,自己莽撞闯祸，搅了天上的买卖也就罢了,"Now, in your folly, you've hindered the dealings of the Court."
Crane Immortal,还捎上个自不量力的小女娃,"But above that, you've given a girl who knows no limits a false hope."
Crane Immortal,你放心，我定会将她好生炼成颗金丹，替你收着,I shall transform her into a mighty golden pill and keep it safe for you.
Crane Immortal,你若下辈子还要闹腾，记得来天上取,"Think about her, won't you? Should you feel like stirring trouble in your next life."
Zhu Bajie,老猪当年总督天河，掌管八万水兵大众,"Time was, I guarded the Celestial River, with my boys eighty thousand strong."
Zhu Bajie,这些个阴兵鬼卒也敢拦路？,And the puny revenants dare to impede me?
Zhu Bajie,若不是靠我神妙变化，你今日准交代在这了,That grand transformation of mine was the only reason you're still standing here.
Zhu Bajie,给叔叔磕个响头罢？,"A proper kneel to show gratitude would be appropriate, no?"
Zhu Bajie,哼，吃过一回亏，再无第二回！,"Hmph. Fooled me once, never again!"
Zhu Bajie,这等撒诈捣虚之徒，不足为惧,Deceptive tactics like this pose no threat.
Zhu Bajie,我先过去探个实信，你小子速速跟上,"I'll go size them up first. Keep pace, boy!"
Pale-Axe Stalwart,竟是你这猴头……,"Oh, lad, it can't be you!"
Pale-Axe Stalwart,刚刚与那些阴兵正打杀着，不知为何昏了神……,I thought you were one of them. What happened to me...
Pale-Axe Stalwart,吾乃牛魔王麾下先锋，还好未伤你性命！,The vanguard of the Bull King is relieved you're unharmed.
Pale-Axe Stalwart,饶你，饶你！,"Well, consider yourself lucky!"
Pale-Axe Stalwart,你的事我早有耳闻,I knew of you long ago.
Pale-Axe Stalwart,你要寻的东西，老大王定然知道,"The thing you seek, the king must know about it."
Pale-Axe Stalwart,如今山里生了妖孽，不知哪里冒出这些个阴兵,"Out of nowhere, the whole mountain was infested with those stinking corpses."
Pale-Axe Stalwart,上山的关隘也被几辆棺材车拦住，冒着邪火烧老子……,"Some coffin carts blocked all the passes up, burning everything in their path."
Pale-Axe Stalwart,我想你有些溜撒，寻个法儿，把它们都拆了，如何？,"You seem clever. How about you find a way to destroy them, eh?"
Pale-Axe Stalwart,棺材车又叫五行车，是大王的孩儿炼化出来的异物，厉害得很,"They’re called ""Five Element Carts”, an evil and powerful invention of the king's son."
Pale-Axe Stalwart,那车儿怕不只是阻止我等上山,I'm afraid they are not only guarding the passes.
Pale-Axe Stalwart,我觉得其中定有蹊跷！,"Trust me, there's more to it!"
Pale-Axe Stalwart,眼下老子还得守住山门，这火焰山乱成一团，没了我可不行哩,Got to hold my ground at the entrance for a while. Can't imagine the chaos without me!
Pale-Axe Stalwart,老子往这一站……,I tolerate no evil under my nose...
Pale-Axe Stalwart,谁敢来！,Neither does my axe!
Pale-Axe Stalwart,再来几个阴兵让老子杀杀才痛快！,Bring me more revenants so I can chop them up!
Pale-Axe Stalwart,听着！,Heed my words!
Pale-Axe Stalwart,红孩儿出动五行车儿，行的是障眼法,The Red Boy's carts are nothing more than a distraction.
Pale-Axe Stalwart,得亏老子聪明！,Thinks he can outwit me!
Pale-Axe Stalwart,呸！小杂种！,Bah! That brat!
Pale-Axe Stalwart,你速速上山，我倒要看看他葫芦里卖的什么药,Make haste and head up the mountain. We must figure out what he's planning.
Pale-Axe Stalwart,杀了个爽！,What a great fight!
Pale-Axe Stalwart,瞧见没，老子大斧一挥……,You see how l swung my axe?
Pale-Axe Stalwart,那个不孝子不知从哪听来些鬼话，竟在火焰山弄出这么大动静,"Someone fed that unruly boy a load of nonsense, and now he's running amok."
Pale-Axe Stalwart,老大王为何任其摆布？,Why doesn't the king take action?
Pale-Axe Stalwart,凭他的本事，十个红孩儿也不是对手！,"With his might, he could take down ten Red Boys!"
Pale-Axe Stalwart,老大王远远瞧着，身旁既不见坐骑，更不见混铁棍……,"I can see the king from here, stripped of his mount and weapon."
Pale-Axe Stalwart,这其中到底有何缘由……火焰山究竟还有什么……,I wonder what's behind all this... What else is hidden in this mountain?
Pale-Axe Stalwart,看不明白！看不明白！,I feel blind! Blind!
Pale-Axe Stalwart,得先找到璧水金晴兽才好,We should find the king's mount first...
Pale-Axe Stalwart,璧水金晴兽是老大王的心爱坐骑，如同手足弟兄，怎会不见了？,The Bishui Beast is treasured by the king as his own kin. How could it simply vanish?
Pale-Axe Stalwart,牛魔王仁义无双,My king... He treated me well...
Pale-Axe Stalwart,侍奉他我心甘情愿,"To die for him, I would not regret it."
Pale-Axe Stalwart,唯独，辜负了大哥,But I've failed Brother.
Pale-Axe Stalwart,他交给我的差事办砸了,Failing his mission is what l regret...
Pale-Axe Stalwart,为了那孽畜，老大王定是做了什么蠢事,My king must've done something reckless for that darn boy.
Pale-Axe Stalwart,这个秘密，恐怕都在那扇门后面,"The truth, I wager, lies beyond that door."
Pale-Axe Stalwart,那小小鬼车，不在话下,That accursed cart was no match for me.
Pale-Axe Stalwart,老子是故意让它几手！,"I... I went easy on it, that's all!"
Pale-Axe Stalwart,你是个顶好的猴头，但千万……,Quite a good lad you are. But remember...
Pale-Axe Stalwart,千万不要舍本……,don't be swayed...
Pale-Axe Stalwart,逐末……,Stay true...
Pingping (Red Boy),谁来救救我啊！,Somebody help!
Pingping (Red Boy),救人，小师父救人呐！救人！,"Help! Help me, young master!"
Pingping (Red Boy),猴哥哥，是你！,"It's you, kind monkey!"
Pingping (Red Boy),救我！猴哥哥救我啊！,"Help me! Help me, please!"
Pingping (Red Boy),山中生了变故，只有我逃了出来,"Things went south in the mountain, and I barely escaped."
Pingping (Red Boy),不想下山路上，又被妖人擒住,"But on my way down, guais captured me."
Pingping (Red Boy),在这儿吊了三日三夜……,I've been kept here for three days...
Pingping (Red Boy),不知哪世修来的缘法，今生得遇好哥哥,But now my luck has returned. My savior appeared here right in front of me!
Pingping (Red Boy),若肯舍大慈悲，救我一家老小,Should you extend your mercy to save my family.
Pingping (Red Boy),就算典身卖命，也要酬谢大恩,I'll repay your kindness at any cost.
Quick as Fire,大王说的没错,Master got it right.
Quick as Fire,这小娘儿叫唤起来果然勾人,The lass surely knows how to ask for help.
Pingping (Red Boy),这声音？,"Oh, no..."
Pingping (Red Boy),是他们……,It's them.
Pingping (Red Boy),抓我的人回来了！,My captors are back!
Pingping (Red Boy),哥哥快点救我！,Please don't leave me!
Fast as Wind,嘿嘿嘿，好个愿者上钩,"Heh-heh, an easy catch!"
Fast as Wind,现在怎么办？,And what now?
Fast as Wind,嗯嘿嘿，通通烧死，烧个皮焦肉烂！,"Heh-heh, burn them all to cinders! Bum them bur them!"
Zhu Bajie,贤侄好风流,"Quite the charmer, aren't you boy!"
Zhu Bajie,比老猪更怜香惜玉,But these eyes have seen prettier disguises.
Zhu Bajie,妖精！,Yaoguai!
Zhu Bajie,姓甚名谁，老实说来！,"Your true face, out with it!"
Zhu Bajie,若有半句编谎,"If a single lie slips,"
Zhu Bajie,叔叔的钉钯可不长眼！,my rake shall strike true!
Pingping (Red Boy),好险好险，多谢恩人搭救,That was so close! Thank you for saving me!
Pingping (Red Boy),我是大力王的女儿，名叫萍萍……,"I am the Bull King's daughter, Pingping..."
Zhu Bajie,胡柴！,Nonsense!
Zhu Bajie,牛魔王何来女儿,The Bull has no daughter!
Zhu Bajie,哄骗我老猪，讨打！,"Dare to fool me, scoundrel?!"
Pingping (Red Boy),我……记得你,I... I know who you are!
Pingping (Red Boy),我母亲玉面公主……,My mother is Princess Fair Fox.
Pingping (Red Boy),就是被你所杀！,You killed her!
Pingping (Red Boy),母亲死后，我便一直跟着父亲生活,"After my mother died, I've been living with my father."
Pingping (Red Boy),铁扇公主心善，认我做了养女,"His wife, Princess Rakshasi, took me in as her own."
Pingping (Red Boy),后来……,Later...
Pingping (Red Boy),哥哥从南海学成回来，我们一家团聚,"Brother came back from Bodhisattva Guanyin, and we reunited."
Pingping (Red Boy),终于过上安宁日子,We had some peaceful days.
Pingping (Red Boy),哥哥一向孝顺,"My brother was kind,"
Pingping (Red Boy),对我也甚是关照,to me and to our parents.
Pingping (Red Boy),可是不知怎的，不久前他忽然性情大变,"But somehow, not long ago, he suddenly changed."
Pingping (Red Boy),他悄悄招了火云洞的旧部过来,"He secretly summoned his old troops for a coup,"
Pingping (Red Boy),先是囚了父亲，又困住母亲,"imprisoned Father, kept Mother under strict watch."
Pingping (Red Boy),我……我实在没有法子了,I... I had nowhere else to turn.
Pingping (Red Boy),才跑出来搬救兵,I had to go for help.
Pingping (Red Boy),可可的一出山口，就撞见了哥哥的手下……,"But barely after leaving the place, his minions fell upon me..."
Zhu Bajie,那牛魔王神通无穷,The Bull King's might is known.
Zhu Bajie,我跟师兄两人才斗他不过,"Even together, Wukong and I couldn't rival him."
Zhu Bajie,铁扇仙更有灵宝护身,Rakshasi's Plantain Fan is also formidable.
Zhu Bajie,怎么到了你这女怪嘴里，说囚就囚了？,And you want me to believe that they were subdued by a kid?
Pingping (Red Boy),谁能料到自己儿子反目成仇,Subdued by their son?
Pingping (Red Boy),做父母的，谁又真的狠心对亲生孩子动手？,"Who else could make them put their guard down? Really, with soft hearts, they could never harm him."
Zhu Bajie,呆子，这小狐狸哄你玩呢！,You idiot! This fox is fooling you!
Pingping (Red Boy),你们看看这里……,Look at this place.
Pingping (Red Boy),若不是哥哥的三昧真火，又怎会落得如此凄惨！,Only my brother's Samadhi Fire could wreak such havoc!
Pingping (Red Boy),不好！,Oh no!
Pingping (Red Boy),父亲性命顷刻即休，请猴哥哥务必助我一家渡此劫难……,"My father is dying. Please, kind monkey, help me and my family...."
Zhu Bajie,火焰山极凶极险,"A perilous place, this is."
Zhu Bajie,这只蟭蟟虫儿你却收好,Keep this cicada safe with you.
Zhu Bajie,到时自有用处,It'll come in handy.
Zhu Bajie,这声音耳熟得很,That's a voice I know well.
Zhu Bajie,老猪我去探探便知,I'll go ahead and take a look.
Pingping (Red Boy),来不及了,No time to lose now.
Pingping (Red Boy),猴哥哥，我在前面带路,Follow me.
Pingping (Red Boy),快来！,This way!
Pingping (Red Boy),适才那位猪长老，跟你说了什么悄悄话？,What secrets did Master Pig whisper to you just now?
Pingping (Red Boy),我且不计较从前血债，他倒好，竟还有如此大的敌意……,"I've let go of our blood feud, but he still holds so much hostility..."
Pingping (Red Boy),这山里山外，到处都是哥哥的手下,My brother's minions are everywhere.
Pingping (Red Boy),猴哥哥务必跟紧我,"Stay close to me, kind monkey."
Pingping (Red Boy),从前，哥哥常与我在这山间玩耍,Brother and I used to play around there.
Pingping (Red Boy),那六健将还会逗我们开心，好生快活,The Valiant Six had their ways of amusing us. What fun we had together.
Pingping (Red Boy),此处有洞能过，我先行，猴哥哥径自往前出去,"I'll get through this hole, and you can pass by that crack ahead."
Pingping (Red Boy),两只脚比不过四只脚,My paws beat your feet!
Pingping (Red Boy),是父亲的声音……他就在那儿！,That's Father... He's right there.
Pingping (Red Boy),哥哥的三昧真火实在厉害，上山的路，都已封死了……,My brother's Samadhi fire has obstructed all paths uphill.
Pingping (Red Boy),要灭此火，须得用到母亲的芭蕉扇……可是母亲她……,"To quench it, Mother's Plantain Fan is a must... But she'd never..."
Pingping (Red Boy),从这里跳下，有条密道通往母亲的寝宫,"Down this cliff, there is a secret passage to her palace."
Pingping (Red Boy),她应该还在里面,She should be there.
Pingping (Red Boy),母亲一向溺爱哥哥，怎肯轻易交出扇子……,But she'd never give you the fan to be used against her precious son...
Pingping (Red Boy),我想起来！,Got it!
Pingping (Red Boy),旁边不远的地界，另有一位高人居住，据说以前也是母亲的故友,"Quite nearby, there is a deity we can turn to - one said to be Mother's old friend."
Pingping (Red Boy),如能再请他出山，与我们一同劝说母亲，借出芭蕉扇的机会，又能再大几分！,"If we could persuade him to come along, maybe he could talk Mother into giving us the fan."
Pingping (Red Boy),我速去速回，猴哥哥自己当心啊！,I'll go find him. Be careful out here!
"Mist Cloud, Cloud Mist",猴子，棍子，死的，活的，大王，都要！,"Wanted monkey, wanted staff. Wanted, dead, or alive!"
"Mist Cloud, Cloud Mist",站住！大王有令，擅闯娘娘禁宫者，杀！,Halt! Intruders...to the Princess' palace face death.
Zhu Bajie,这只蟭蟟虫儿你却收好,Keep this cicada safe with you.
Zhu Bajie,到时自有用处,It'll come in handy.
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),哥哥长，哥哥短，不好生陪着你那哥哥，来这里作甚？,"Enough about your brother! If you care for him so much, why not go back to him and give me some peace?"
Pingping (Red Boy),孩儿想……想借母亲的芭蕉扇去救父王,"If you won't act, Mother, then I implore you... to lend me your Plantain Fan to save Father."
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),救，火焰山这场劫，一柄扇子，怕是救不了,Save him? Or this mountain from its doom? Both are beyond this fan.
Pingping (Red Boy),母亲！母亲，女儿求求你了！,"Mother, please... I am begging you!"
Pingping (Red Boy),再这么拖下去，哥哥的凶性一发，父王怕是必死无疑！,Father's life hangs on a thread. A thread which brother could cut short any moment!
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),你是当真关心那放荡老牛？,Since when did you start caring for that old bull?
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),别以为做娘的不知你那点小心思,Do not think you can hide your secret wish from me!
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),难保不是盼望我们都气死了,"You wish you could rule this mountain with your brother,"
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),好与你哥哥在这山中逍遥快活,once we are finished...
Pingping (Red Boy),母亲冤枉！,"That is not true, Mother..."
Pingping (Red Boy),若不是心忧父王安危，我何苦找到上仙一起来这里央求,"If that were my wish, why would l bring this Master here to help?"
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),哼，狐狸精就是狐狸精,Hmph. Words from cunning foxes...
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),我看你只想骗去芭蕉扇，做个人情献给孽儿,You just want to trade my fan for a smile on your brother's face.
Pingping (Red Boy),我……我是父王的亲生骨肉,"I... I owe my life to Father,"
Pingping (Red Boy),承蒙母亲不弃，才得以苟活至今,and to your kindness for taking me in.
Pingping (Red Boy),哥哥待我再好，又怎比得上双亲的天恩,Brother was good to me. But I would never betray my parents for him...
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),扇子的事，我意已决,Say no more of the fan.
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),当时多造的孽缘，如今不配自怜,We raised the boy. Guess this is what we deserve.
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),反倒是你,But you...
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),挑这个时候来，是何缘由？,Why are you here at this very moment?
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,师姐,"Rakshasi,"
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,这是你的家事,I'm not a part of your family.
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,我一介外人，本不便置喙,And I'm aware I have no voice in this.
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,但萍儿找到我说，天命人已经到了火焰山,But Ping told me the Destined One had arrived.
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),天命天命，乖乖听老天命令,The Destined One who doesn't even know what he's destined for?
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),几个老不死，名字起得倒怪传神的,Those old bastards must've pulled a muscle coming up with the name.
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,他的真实来历，你我皆知,You and I both know who he truly is.
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,届时……,When the time comes...
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,你的儿女也好，丈夫也罢，连上这罗刹宝地,"Your children, your husband, and even this very palace."
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,都难逃灰飞烟灭,could all turn to ashes.
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),一颗身不由己的棋子，来了又有何惧？,What do l have to fear from a mere pawn?
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),不说老牛与孩儿,He's no match for us.
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),我那芭蕉扇，也不是吃素的,He can't even rival the power of my fan.
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,他前脚得知身世，天命人后脚就到,"Once the truth is revealed, suddenly he is here."
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,两事同时发生，师姐不觉得诡异吗？,"Do you not find it odd, such a twist of fate?"
Pingping (Red Boy),身世……？,The truth?
Pingping (Red Boy),什么身世？,The truth of what?
Pingping (Red Boy),你们在说谁？,Who are you talking about?
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,我听闻剩余几个遗物，都已落入天命人之手,I heard the Destined One had obtained all the other relics.
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,师姐，事已至此……,"Rakshasi, your situation is grave..."
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,你还不明白吗？,Do you not see?
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,是谁让他回来的？,Who mandated his return?
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,那些东西，当真是修炼至宝？,Were those relics really bestowed for your good?
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,只怕我们一个个自作聪明,"Perhaps, amidst these schemes and plots,"
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,到头来反倒成了助他还魂的祭品,we've unwittingly become stepping stones for his rebirth.
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,我不在意别人死活,"For others, I care not."
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,我……我从来……,All along...
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,都只在意你一个人,you are all I care for.
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,不如,"I say,"
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,我们两个一起走罢！,we should leave together!
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,当年在上面我如何待你,"I vow to treasure you dearly,"
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,今后也会如何待你！,just like when we’re up there.
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),师弟……,I never thought...
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),到了这种时候，竟只有你，还挂念着我,That one day you'd be the only one l can rely on.
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),我……我一下没了主意,I am overwhelmed...
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),来，坐上来,"Come sit with me,"
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),与我细说,and tell me what to do.
Pingping (Red Boy),母亲，不可信他,"Don't let him, Mother! "
Pingping (Red Boy),这厮面露奸相，定有轻薄之意！,Don't you see? He is taking advantage of you!
Pingping (Red Boy),淫贼！,You lecher!
Pingping (Red Boy),我是白瞎了请你救人，你竟趁人之危,"I called for your help, not your treachery."
Pingping (Red Boy),你，你敢！,How... how dare you!
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,长辈们说话,A child of a concubine...
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,轮不到一个庶女弄舌,should know better manners.
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,我与你母亲相识的时候,"When I first crossed paths with her,"
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,你那父王，大约还套着牛梭子,"your bull of a father was no more than livestock,"
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,不知在哪里犁地呢,munching on a patch of grass.
Pingping (Red Boy),淫贼！下贱！母亲别信他！,"Have you no shame? Mother, don't be fooled!"
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,你啊，一边清静清静！,Enough of your endless prattle!
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,这才好些,Now that's better.
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,师姐，下界之后，小仙……,"Rakshasi, have we not been this close..."
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,还从没离你这么近过,since our time in Tushita Palace?
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),师弟，这些年其实我……,"Well yes...I do miss the old days, too..."
Princess Rakshasi (Zhu Bajie),也很怀念宫里的日子,We were so happy back then...
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,这是何物,What in the blazes?!
Zhu Bajie,猪蹄啊，还能是什么？,No tricks here—it's just my hoof.
Zhu Bajie,再不现形，你要扑上来啃一口了！,You deserve to know before we kiss!
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,气杀我也，气杀我也！,You'll live to repent this!
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,好个腌臜东西,Filthy lowlife!
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,竟敢化作师姐模样诈我！,You dare to take her form and beguile me?
Zhu Bajie,老朋友，见甚么外呢？,"My old friend, wasn't it fun?"
Zhu Bajie,咱俩携手剿灭狐狸洞的日子，我老猪也想念得紧呢,"Have we not been this close, since our carnage in the fox den?"
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,狡猾东西,You abhorrent fraud!
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,亏我一片诚心,My candid words...
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,竟着了你这恶心手段！,were wasted on your foul ears!
Zhu Bajie,扯什么淡！,Candid my hoof!
Zhu Bajie,这一路的阴兵鬼将，以为老猪看不出是谁的杰作？,Your revenants are everywhere. I thought you'd have better lies.
Zhu Bajie,哟，贤侄，你也到了？,"Quick on your heels, huh?"
Zhu Bajie,正好正好，与叔叔一起会会这坏了纲常的烂淫贱货！,"Well then boy, let us teach this brazen adulterer a lesson!"
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,孽畜，这么多年了，还是妖性难移,Vile beast! Your savagery knows no cure.
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,我这兜帅宫的无根水一旦落了地，看你还如何放肆！,But you will behave once my Sourceless Water from Tushita drops.
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,曾经我助你等西行,I've aided your journey once.
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,今日不妨再送一程,"Now, I shall aid you again - on your way to death."
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,阴阳之道，一向一背,"""From yin and yang, arises two sides."""
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,天地之道，一升一降,"""From land and sky, emerges a divide."""
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,今日就拿你这毛贼，喂喂我的阴阳鱼儿,Now... you shall be feasted upon.... by my Yin-Yang Fish!
Zhu Bajie,这家子真不知礼数,What a stingy host!
Zhu Bajie,弄这么条小鱼儿,Such a meager fish...
Zhu Bajie,还不够请咱吃饭呢,...hardly enough for a platter!
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,身世之谜已揭,The truth has been revealed.
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,红孩儿是不会善罢甘休的,Disasters are sure to follow.
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,你眼里这地覆天翻,The turmoil you witness...
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,不过是人家案板上一碗冷饭……,is but a ripple caused by a drop from above.
Zhu Bajie,这厮溜了？,Wha... Gone already?
Zhu Bajie,老猪我才刚打了个盹,Bad news after a good nap.
Zhu Bajie,小小丹童这等猖狂,He's gone too far from a furnace servant.
Zhu Bajie,以前也是个清白出身,"A decent lad, he was."
Zhu Bajie,说起来，都是大师兄造的孽……,"Decent, until ruined by Brother Wukong..."
Zhu Bajie,命不好就罢了，又爱上了不该爱的人,Then destiny carried him further to fall for the wrong woman.
Zhu Bajie,你，从这边上去,"You, go up this way,"
Zhu Bajie,看看有无通路,check if any way leads up.
Zhu Bajie,我再去四处找寻找寻,I'll go look around.
Zhu Bajie,老娘虽然跑了，难说宝贝还在山内,"The owner might be gone, but her treasure might still be there."
Pingping (Red Boy),猴哥哥，快来快来,"Come here, kind monkey!"
Pingping (Red Boy),我在这里！,I'm over here!
Pingping (Red Boy),扇子我找着了，你看！,I found the fan. Look!
Pingping (Red Boy),母亲大抵是左右为难，才匿了行踪，却把扇子留了下来,Mother left her fan before she went away. She must have felt torn between her son and husband.
Pingping (Red Boy),只是这大铁球滚来滚去，不见消停……,But this iron ball... It just won't stop.
Pingping (Red Boy),幸好猴哥哥及时赶到,Now that you are here!
Pingping (Red Boy),你且助我引开它，我好举扇灭火,"Help me drive it away, and I'll let the fan do its work!"
Zhu Bajie,小狐狸,"Hey, fox."
Zhu Bajie,这当真……是芭蕉扇？,How can you be sure it's even real?
Pingping (Red Boy),放心放心，母亲曾教过我使用口诀,Rest assured. Mother taught me this spell.
Pingping (Red Boy),一扇下去，便知真假,Only the real fan will answer it.
Zhu Bajie,那老牛哼哼的十分虚切，估着只剩半口气了,"The Bull sounds weak, probably on his last legs."
Zhu Bajie,老猪姑且信你一次，尽点力气挡住那铁球，你趁机使出扇子,Guess l have to trust you once. I'll get down there and stop the ball and let you do your work.
Pingping (Red Boy),猪八戒皮糙肉厚，死不掉的,Don't worry. His thick skin will protect him!
Pingping (Red Boy),猴哥哥，先随我一起去救父亲要紧！,"Come on, let's save Father first!"
"Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top",贼婆娘快看，居然有个毛脸的，生得比我还丑,"Did you see that fur-face, wicked lass? He's even uglier than me!"
"Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top",贼汉子，我看你是耍糊涂了,"Are you still in the haze or what, you wicked lad?"
"Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top",夫人交代我俩守住此地，你管他丑不丑，闯进来的只管杀掉！,"Our lady asked us to guard this place, not to check another face! Kill whoever breaks in was the order!"
"Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top",得令！,By your word!
Bottom Takes Top,这么蛮横，就留你去喂那老牛的紫皮狮子狗罢,"You're a cruel one! Fine, go feed yourself to that old bull's purply pup."
Bottom Takes Top,老娘不陪了,I'm done playing with you.
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,不哭不哭,"Shh, there, there."
Princess Rakshasi,师父只道让这孩子平安降生，却不知带累我遭了多大磨难,"Our master bade this child be born, but he never knew my struggles."
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,师父的示下，我们怎能不从,How can we but follow the master's word?
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,况且，师姐你已当着他老人家的面，饮了子母河的水,"Rakshasi, you know it was he who made you drink from the River of Childbearing."
Princess Rakshasi,住口，这事莫要再提,Shut it. You shall never speak of it.
Princess Rakshasi,大王明知我不得不饮……,The king knows why I had to drink it...
Princess Rakshasi,可从那之后，脸都没露过，还多了个不归家的借口,But I haven't glimpsed him...ever since then. He made it another reason for his absence.
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,师姐，那老牛定是见不得这些,"Rakshasi, your husband shirks a dishonor this way."
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,他能给你腾出此洞，又派金晴兽把守，已是给足了师父情面,"He granted you this cave, with his mount Bishui Beast as its sentinel. He's compromised enough for the sake of our master. "
Princess Rakshasi,你千万要守紧嘴巴,You will seal your lips on this.
Princess Rakshasi,若是再有他人晓得了此子来历，我们一家必有大难,Our family would be doomed if anyone knew the truth behind this child.
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,师姐放心，师父已让我来此作暗中协助,Fear not. Master bids me aid you in secret.
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,你且与那老牛好好将他抚养成人,"You and the bull, you will rear this child to manhood."
Keeper of the Flaming Mountains,待这娃儿长大，灵山的那些血债，他便是最好的人证,"And when the boy comes of age... well, on that day...he will be living proof...of the dark deeds of Mount Lingshan."
Pingping (Red Boy),父亲，父亲，天命人我带来了,"Father, I've brought him here - it's the Destined One."
Pingping (Red Boy),趁着哥哥不在，父亲可把那东西交还于他,Brother is not around. You can hand it over to him now.
Pingping (Red Boy),此物一旦物归原主，哥哥自然死心,Brother will surely give up on his plan once it's returned.
Pingping (Red Boy),火焰山的劫数，也便解了,"And then, we will be a family again."
Bull King,好个泼猢狲……,You mischievous monkey...
Bull King,怎么作死……,You dare to push your luck....
Bull King,都死不干净,but always have a way out...
Bull King,可惜……,Only...
Bull King,来得不是时候……,You came back at the wrong time...
Pingping (Red Boy),父亲糊涂了吗？,"Are you not thinking straight, Father?"
Pingping (Red Boy),小女把天命人带来救你了,I brought the Destined One here to save you.
Bull King,是糊涂喽……,"I may be unwell,"
Bull King,可眼没糊涂……,but l am not blind...
Bull King,你……不是我女儿,You... are not my daughter.
Pingping (Red Boy),父亲此话从何说起？,How can you say that to me?
Pingping (Red Boy),萍萍吃尽千辛万苦，寻了人，灭了火,I went through flames to find the Destined One for you.
Pingping (Red Boy),不就是为了回到父亲这里？,For you Father! Don't you see?
Bull King,早知把眼也戳瞎好了……,"I should have plucked my eyes out too,"
Bull King,免得见你作怪……,to save me from your pretense...
Red Boy,莫急啊，老畜生,"Worry not, "
Red Boy,,"old, horned fool."
Red Boy,一会儿就遂了你意,I'll see to it shortly.
Red Boy,枉我卖弄这般手段,You could have enjoyed a good show...
Red Boy,没意思，真没意思,But you simply lack the taste.
Red Boy,不如都杀了利索！,I should've just killed you all!
Red Boy,我打扮做那小妖精，自问一般无二,My guise was perfect. None could see a single flaw in it.
Red Boy,你是怎么看穿的？,How did you find out then?
Bull King,她……不像你……,Unlike you...
Bull King,面上敬我，心里一点不惧,she has never needed to fake her respect for me.
Red Boy,原来如此,Interesting.
Red Boy,少不得要再把那小贱人抓回来，好好耍子一番,That little fox. I will find out if it's true after I hunt her down.
Red Boy,不过,"But first,"
Red Boy,眼下先把你们两个好兄弟，烧成灰葬在一起,I should burn you two together and mix your ashes to honor your friendship.
Red Boy,闲情雅致,Entertainment...
Red Boy,时候多的是！,That can wait!
Bull King,你这孙子……,You cursed monkey...
Bull King,走到哪里……,Wherever you go...
Bull King,哪里就家破人亡……,you leave behind a ruined family...
Bull King,小儿虽一时落败，但精气未散,"My son is defeated, but not vanquished..."
Bull King,只怕不过半晌还能站起来,I am afraid he'll rise again soon.
Bull King,这东西，我得来后一直封在胃囊,"Since it came into my possession, I've kept it in my stomach,"
Bull King,无人知晓,hidden from all.
Bull King,我老了……,I am old now...
Bull King,什么都怕……,Fears have grown in me...
Bull King,怕战,"Fear of war,"
Bull King,怕死,"fear of death,"
Bull King,怕老婆,"fear of my wife,"
Bull King,怕儿子,fear of my son...
Bull King,所以……,That is why...
Bull King,我不敢吃,I dare not consume it....
Bull King,他来要，我更不敢给……,let alone give it back to him...
Bull King,狗屁天命，都是苦命,"Destined, deprived, it's all the same"
Bull King,切莫信了这些方便,Don't ever believe their bullshit.
Bull King,此番能否再修正果，全凭之前因缘造化,"You are your choices, your causes and effects, not what you're called."
Yaksha King,多亏这张闭气符,Thanks to this false death talisman.
Yaksha King,那土地老儿虽然技不如人，也算死得其所,"Poor Keeper, seems his legacy was his only offer after all."
Zhu Bajie,我说怎么扇了没下一滴雨,No wonder not a single raindrop was fanned!
Zhu Bajie,原来一直是你这憨儿在捉弄我,It was your trick the whole time!
Zhu Bajie,牛哥，老猪来迟一步，对不住,"My bad, old bull. I was a bit delayed."
Zhu Bajie,臭小子，叔叔今日就代你父母，执行家法！,You little rascal. I'll teach you a lesson on your parents' behalf!
Yaksha King,诸佛说此色非命，然则如何命在身,"""The Buddhas say my flesh is not life's core, so whence springs existence, I implore?"""
Yaksha King,此骨与肉何处来，如何此生住母胎,"""What ordained their dwelling in my mother's womb, if blood and flesh don't compose my life's bloom?"""
Yaksha King,可悲,The Destined One...
Yaksha King,可悲啊,"Oh, the irony!"
Yaksha King,我本无意与你为敌,"Tell me then, is my kind destined for extermination?"
Yaksha King,但你对他们的手段一无所知,"A monkey born from unfeeling stone,"
Yaksha King,过了火焰山，还有灵山，你过得了吗!,can never understand my pain.
Zhu Bajie,你这厮甚不通变，唉……,"Still holding on, despite it all?"
Zhu Bajie,只想着报仇，家都不要了,Does your vengeance weigh more than your family?
Zhu Bajie,把师兄的东西吐出来！,Spit it out now! His relic!
Princess Rakshasi,奴家来迟，大王受苦了,"My King, I'm sorry for my lateness."
Princess Rakshasi,他们……,I turned to them...
Princess Rakshasi,没一个肯来……,But none offered help...
Bull King,夫人……罢了……,My Lady... Forget it...
Princess Rakshasi,两位上仙,I implore you...
Princess Rakshasi,万望垂慈，饶我儿一命,...to show mercy and spare my son.
Princess Rakshasi,这孩子，是西方夜叉部仅剩的一缕血脉,"He's the last of the Yaksha's bloodline in the West,"
Princess Rakshasi,身世之悲惨离奇，世间罕有,with an origin most tragic and twisted
Princess Rakshasi,他现在已无还手之力,Now he poses a threat no more.
Princess Rakshasi,若能放他一条生路……,"Should you grant him mercy,"
Princess Rakshasi,我罗刹女与大力王，情愿虔心隐性，坐关修行,"I, Rakshasi, and the Bull King shall retreat ourselves to secluded meditation."
Princess Rakshasi,连同一对儿女，永驻火焰山……,"Along with our children, we will never leave the mountain again..."
Princess Rakshasi,我夫妻两人……,He is our son.
Princess Rakshasi,甘心代他受罚！,We will bear his punishment!
Princess Rakshasi,如果上仙不弃，这把宝扇……,"If it pleases you, my Plantain Fan..."
Princess Rakshasi,也一并送上……,is also yours to take.
Yaksha King,有经处有火,"""Flames have paved my way..."""
Yaksha King,无火处无经,"""Through flames, I shan't stray."""
Yaksha King,知仇不报，何来修行！,"Vain was my flame, for a revenge destined astray!"
Yaksha King,他们想看的……,"Their delight lies in our submission,"
Yaksha King,正是如今，我们跪着的模样,kneeling and begging.
Yaksha King,我……,You...
Yaksha King,偏不让你们……,shall never witness it...
Yaksha King,遂心！,from me!
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",熊罴，你戴罪立功，赐眼一对,"You've atoned through deeds, Black Bear. Take this pair of eyes!"
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",貂鼠，你替天行道，耳朵拿去,"You've served the righteous cause, Yellow Rat. These ears are yours!"
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",黄眉，你重振旗鼓，鼻子收好,"Your power has gathered anew, Yellowbrow. Keep this nose!"
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",百眼，你忍辱负重，舌头领下,"You've endured hardships, Hundred-Eyed. Go with the tongue."
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",牛魔，你大义灭亲，最是不易,"And the bull, it is the hardest to turn against a sworn brother."
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",他的身子，留给你了,You can have his body!
Sun Wukong,你这老牛，真是晦气到家了,"Hah, wretched bull, ill luck plagues your every step!"
Sun Wukong,这一辈子，就没选对过一次,Never have you made a good choice.
Sun Wukong,牛哥，你省些力气,"Save your strength, Brother."
Sun Wukong,咱们还要杀上天去，擒那玉帝老儿！,We're yet to slay our way to the Court and seize that senile Emperor!
Sun Wukong,此子看着像是天兵头领,This one must be the chief of their troop.
Sun Wukong,牛哥你帮我殿后，我去会他一会,"Brother, watch my back while I go play with him."
Princess Rakshasi,我知你不情愿，可我又何尝不是勉强,"Your reluctance is plain, just like my own."
Princess Rakshasi,那孩子……,They forced me...
Princess Rakshasi,是他们逼我吃了子母河的水，借腹而生,"to drink from the River of Childbearing, to bear that boy in my womb."
Princess Rakshasi,若无那只猴子，我们本可当这一切从未发生,"If not for that monkey, we could've lived our separate lives in peace,"
Princess Rakshasi,你我从此两地分居，各自清静……,as if none of this had happened...
Yaksha King,老匹夫！,You old coot!
Yaksha King,你早知我身世，为何还愿做他们的狗,You knew who I was from the start. Why'd you choose to be their lapdog?
Yaksha King,孩儿本不想与你恩断义绝,I never wanted to sever our ties.
Yaksha King,你若还念一丝骨肉情分，就该把那东西交付于我,"If kinship means anything to you, give me that relic,"
Yaksha King,放我回去给同族报仇！,and let me avenge my people!
Princess Rakshasi,大王！,My king!
Princess Rakshasi,这把扇子送与那猢狲，教他退兵去罢！,"Let the monkey have my fan, and there will be no trouble!"
Sun Wukong,你弟，我教训了,"Your brother, I've disciplined;"
Sun Wukong,你儿，我送人了,"your boy, I've given away."
Sun Wukong,今日你婆娘那柄扇子，我也要定了,"Your wife's fan, today I'll take it with me too!"
Sun Wukong,认师父修正果,Find a master and serve the right.
Sun Wukong,只有这条路是留给我们走的，长兄还不明白吗,"It's the only path left for the likes of us. Don't you understand, Brother?"
Zhu Bajie,猴哥，那老牛的小娘子，也被我一钯筑死了,Wukong! I took out the bull's concubine with a whack of my rake too!
Zhu Bajie,剥开衣看，原来是个玉面狸精,Turned out she was a fox guai!
Sun Wukong,我一直以为，攒了功德，入了仙班,"The way I saw it, with enough merit and a position before the Buddha,"
Sun Wukong,他们就会放过我，也会放过你们,"they would leave me be, and all of you as well..."
Sun Wukong,原来，我这样的人,"Now I see. For someone like me,"
Sun Wukong,只怕独自活着，便是罪过,staying alive is enough to be a transgression.
Sun Wukong,长兄，照顾好妻儿,"Brother, take care of your wife and children."
Sun Wukong,我死后化的东西，碰不得,"And remember, steer clear of my remains..."
Zhu Bajie,好侄儿，我们这是还乡，不是投胎,"We're getting home, son, not getting all worked up."
Zhu Bajie,那老猴子好不好，都在花果山顶上等着呢，不用忙慌,That old monkey's going to be at the mountaintop no matter what. We don't have to rush.
Zhu Bajie,咱们按他吩咐把五根收归来，只待他拿出第六根，齐了！,"We've gathered the five relics, just as he said. All we need now is the sixth one he has!"
Zhu Bajie,猫嚼头的亡人,Curse these wretches!
Zhu Bajie,你瞧，你瞧,Hey! You see?
Zhu Bajie,我就知那老东西定是藏了什么话没讲,I knew there was something that old fool hadn't told us.
Zhu Bajie,不然，那群天上的老爷们怎的又来这山庄作耗了,"Otherwise, no one up above would bother to ruin this place yet again."
Zhu Bajie,不消说，定是因为你了,"They're coming for you, no doubt."
Zhu Bajie,真个是难，真个是难！,I can't bear it. I simply can't!
Zhu Bajie,造化低了，是条绝路,Bad luck. It's a dead end!
Zhu Bajie,你这告黑状的杀才,You nasty slanderer!
Zhu Bajie,我不去找你就罢了，你倒敢来招我,"I let you be, and now you have the gall to show up!"
Zhu Bajie,若论赌手段，你今日就该死了,"If you come at me now, this day will be your last!"
Zhu Bajie,造化，造化！,Fortune's gift it is!
Zhu Bajie,是师兄的筋斗云哩！,It's Wukong's Somersault Cloud!
Zhu Bajie,我正愁该如何捞你，不期这云倒是乖滑,"I was wringing my brain how to fetch you, but this savvy one's already on it!"
Zhu Bajie,想是他在这山间云雾里躲藏了多年，感应到你的五根,It must have been hidden here amongst the mist until it senses the relics on you.
Zhu Bajie,记起旧主人，恰巧救你一命,"Thanks to them, it recalled its master and saved your skin."
Zhu Bajie,它既认得你，倒不如先使唤使唤它,"Now that it answers to your call, why not make a good use of it?"
Zhu Bajie,我虽能化风，可驮不动你的肉骨凡胎,Your mortal body is too heavy for me in my wind form
Zhu Bajie,天兵天将来了这许多，山里定有大事发生，我们且去瞧瞧,"All these henchmen of the Court. What draws them to this mountain, let's find out."
Zhu Bajie,这……,It can't be....
Zhu Bajie,这是师兄的锁子黄金甲！,Wukong's Gold Suozi Armor!
Zhu Bajie,这猴子和老猪一样，浑身是宝,"That monkey was full of surprises, just like me!"
Zhu Bajie,不光自己死不透，连披挂也化作了山中灵物,"He had his way to linger on, and his belongings, too."
Zhu Bajie,还想着杀光天上鹰犬，捎他们下去作陪哩,They're set on killing those mongrels of the Court.
Zhu Bajie,如不能先一步收了它们，却要被这些废物盗去了,"But we've got to snatch them first, or these scum will take them."
Zhu Bajie,老猪先去寻寻其他几件，你速速跟上,I'll go find the other ones. Keep up with me.
Zhu Bajie,好！好！好！,Splendid!
Zhu Bajie,有这两根呆毛，你愈发像那猴子了,"With these silly strands, you're all the more like Wukong!"
Zhu Bajie,只是莫学他倚强撒泼就行,Just don't prance around with your might as he did!
Zhu Bajie,那猴子宝贝多着哩，老猪再四处探探,That monkey's got a stash of treasures. I'll scout around some more.
Zhu Bajie,让开，这次我是头功！,"Step away! This time, the glory's mine!"
Zhu Bajie,罢！罢！罢！,Fine then. Fine!
Zhu Bajie,有你们猴子在，老猪次次都是空忙,"With you monkeys around, I'm always toiling away for nothing."
Zhu Bajie,贤侄，日后平步青云了，可别忘了携带携带叔叔,"Kid, when you step up one day, try not to forget your Uncle Bajie."
Zhu Bajie,别学你那祖宗，好事不曾想过我，脏活累活全拿我顶缸,All I got from Wukong were the nasty jobs. You should do better than that!
Zhu Bajie,此处了账，再去别处看看,We’re done here. Time to move on.
Zhu Bajie,进去了！进去了！,It's in me! It's in me!
Zhu Bajie,哎哟，疼！疼！,"Argh, it hurts! Ouch!"
Zhu Bajie,贤侄，贤侄！,"Kid, kid!"
Zhu Bajie,快救我一救，这东西可不好消化,Help me out here! This is a tough swallow!
Zhu Bajie,好侄儿，你可仔细些，别把叔叔的心肝脾肺打烂了！,"Watch it, kid, will you? Mind my innards while you're fighting in there!"
Zhu Bajie,它是不是不行了？快一棒打死！,Is it down for the count? Now finish it off!
Zhu Bajie,贤侄啊，你是不是惹恼它了,"Did you tick off our friend in there, kid?"
Zhu Bajie,什么动静儿？贤侄，你到底行不行啊？,"What's that sound? Can you handle it or not, kid?"
Zhu Bajie,今次又劳小侄儿救命了,I owe you once more for saving my rump.
Zhu Bajie,老猪吃素，想必里面也不甚腌臜,"My belly's not too vile, is it? I'm not a meat-eater after all."
Zhu Bajie,你莫嫌，你莫嫌,I hope it didn't repulse you.
Zhu Bajie,好在你把这东西取回来，不算太亏,"Well, you've fetched it. It wasn't all that bad, eh?"
Zhu Bajie,现在师兄的金甲都攒齐了，该去那水帘洞里坐坐哩，你随我来,"Now that Wukong's armor set is complete, we should go to Water Curtain Cave. Come with me."
Zhu Bajie,你是哪里来的夷人？,"""Where do you come from, outsider?"""
Zhu Bajie,我这大圣部下的群猴，都是一般模样,"""In my realm, all monkeys are of similar face and shape."""
Zhu Bajie,你这嘴脸生得各样，相貌有些雷堆，定是别处来的妖魔,"""Your face speaks of a different breed. And an ugly one! You must be a yaoguai from another land."""
Zhu Bajie,自从西行之后，我许久没来过此处了，不想还是这模样,I've never ventured here since that journey. Nothing's changed after so many years.
Zhu Bajie,当年他在这座儿上，还押着我给他磕头哩,He said this and told me to kneel. Right here on this seat.
Zhu Bajie,原来藏在这里了,"Ah, here it is!"
Zhu Bajie,果然，连观音都说那猴子一毛不拔,"I knew it. Wukong is tightfisted, even Guanyin agrees so."
Zhu Bajie,这东西必然也是留给猴子猴孙的,He kept it here so it could be passed down to another one of his kind.
Zhu Bajie,小侄儿，还是你来试试罢,"Now it's time for you to try it, kid."
Zhu Bajie,拿了这东西，便不再有退路,"Once you have this, there's no turning back."
Zhu Bajie,你这模样……倒是与师兄一般无二了,Now... you look exactly like Wukong.
Zhu Bajie,贤侄如今披挂齐整，兵器凶横,"You're all set, kid. You look like a fierce warrior!"
Zhu Bajie,速速上山，让我看看那老猴子弄个什么把戏,Come with me! Let's find out what that old monkey is up to.
Zhu Bajie,这些个不识起倒的东西，通通宰了！,These nitwits don't know their place. Let's remind them!
Zhu Bajie,今日就是玉帝老儿自个来了，老猪也不让分毫！,"I won't back down, not even if the Jade Emperor himself showed up today!"
Zhu Bajie,小小天兵，呸！,Minions of the Court. Bah!
Zhu Bajie,去天上打听打听，老猪也是你们惹得起的吗！,Ask around up there. No one dares to meddle with me!
Zhu Bajie,叫你们的主子出来，跟老猪比试比试！,Have your commander step forward if he dares to duel with me!
Zhu Bajie,莫管他们，一群夯货，贤侄你径直上山便是,"Ignore these worthless idiots. Eyes front and up the mountain, kid!"
Zhu Bajie,奶奶的，碍事！,Curse it. You're in my way!
Zhu Bajie,把路给老猪让开！,"Move it or lose it, all of you!"
Zhu Bajie,贤侄！这里，过来，快过来！,"Over here, kid! Hurry! Hurry!"
Zhu Bajie,老家伙说在山顶等我，人影却不见一个,"He said we'd find him here, but I don't see a trace of him."
Zhu Bajie,只留了这块怪石头矗在这，又弄什么玄虚？,There's nothing but a rock here. What's this supposed to mean?
Zhu Bajie,这石头，以我老猪的见识，大抵就是大师兄化成的石卵,"If you ask me, this rock must be the stone egg that holds Wukong."
Zhu Bajie,可我敲了敲无甚反应，你不妨再仔细查勘一番,"I gave it a knock, but nothing happened. Maybe you should have a closer look."
The Old Monkey,来了？,You're here.
Zhu Bajie,来了,We're here.
The Old Monkey,上船,Step abroad.
Zhu Bajie,我说老猴，上了你这贼船，不会回不了头了罢,"Hey, old monkey. I hope this isn't a one-way trip, is it?"
The Old Monkey,天下哪里不是贼船，不上我这艘，你以为就回得了头么,"Isn't all life a one-way trip? Once you embark on the journey, there's no turning back."
Zhu Bajie,这里是什么地方？,What is this place?
The Old Monkey,他的记忆,His memories.
The Old Monkey,那猴子打小就这样，见到好东西一定要拿到手,"Since his early days, he'd had an eye for the finer things,"
The Old Monkey,别人不给，他就抢,and a will to wrest them from others.
The Old Monkey,这眼见便喜，不择手段的臭毛病,"Laying his eyes on, then craving to seize, their riches. "
The Old Monkey,与黑熊金池，又有何分别,"No better than the black bear and Jinchi, I say."
Zhu Bajie,小偷小摸要不得，学佛悟道就是大功德？,"He can't have an eye for the finer things, while the Buddha oversees the three realms?"
Zhu Bajie,我看啊，差不多，都差不多,"Well, I hardly think that's fair."
The Old Monkey,好一只泼猴，在地下成王成圣还不够,"How insatiable! Not content with his kingdom and title below,"
The Old Monkey,偏要跑到天上去讨个官儿做,he asked for a position in the Celestial Court.
The Old Monkey,可这天上没呆几日，只因王母不请他赴宴，便怒发冲冠,"But soon after his wish was granted, his joy turned to rage, all because he wasn't invited to a feast."
The Old Monkey,恨不得把整个天宫都给拆了,He nearly ruined the entire Celestial Palace.
The Old Monkey,耳听即怒，恣意妄为,Ears fume at unfavorable news.
The Old Monkey,和那黄毛畜生一个德性，养不熟，养不熟啊,"As untamed and ungrateful as that yellow rat. Beasts are beasts, don't you think?"
Zhu Bajie,那时他还小，不懂事嘛,He was young. He didn't know any better.
Zhu Bajie,又没佛祖教，又没师父带,Hadn't learned from the Buddha or our Master yet.
Zhu Bajie,你这老人家也忒小气，老揪住人家小时候的丑事不放,Aren't you being a bit harsh dredging up the scandals from his youth?
The Old Monkey,大了也没好到哪儿去,Like his adulthood was any better!
The Old Monkey,他从那五指山下出来后，说是懂了礼数，收了心性,"Since his release, he had claimed to have learned manners and discipline;"
The Old Monkey,车迟国这一泡尿，就全露馅啦,yet his wee prank in Chechi gave him away.
The Old Monkey,目无尊长，自封偶像,"Posing as an idol, he degraded the gods."
The Old Monkey,从来没把佛祖师父那些教诲放在心上,Clear was his defiance of the doctrines he had learned.
Zhu Bajie,顽皮而已,"Well, he was just being naughty."
Zhu Bajie,天生本事大的人，骨子里都有那么点自恋，我也一样,Aren't all great achievers somewhat self-obsessed? Myself included!
The Old Monkey,鼻嗅痴爱，目空一切,"Nose in the air, feeling above others."
The Old Monkey,比起那黄眉小子的狂妄，我看也不遑多让,I say he was no less insolent than that Yellowbrow brat.
Zhu Bajie,这不是那谁么，叫甚么夫人的,"Wait, isn't it that... the lady of some sort?"
Zhu Bajie,弄得师父一怒之下，把师兄赶回了老家,It was her tricks that made Master drive Wukong away.
The Old Monkey,在白虎岭，他倒是狠心绝情,"On White Tiger Ridge, he forsook his love."
The Old Monkey,接连三次打碎过去的爱人，自以为从此不会再有牵挂,"Three times he broke her into pieces, convincing himself his heart would ache no more."
The Old Monkey,可你也明白，他心里根本没有放下,"Yet, as you must know, he had never let go of her."
The Old Monkey,不然也不至于成了佛，仍要执意逃离灵山,"Otherwise, he wouldn't have been so eager to get away from the Buddhahood he attained."
The Old Monkey,舌尝必思，多情易折,Those who talk much of love will one day bite their tongues.
The Old Monkey,这一点他像你，还有你的那些个情人,"On this matter, he was akin to you, and your many darlings."
The Old Monkey,无论身在何处，永远是孽海情天的囚徒,"No matter where you are, you'd always fall captive to the web of mortal desire."
Zhu Bajie,别扯我啊，老猪是慧根不够,"Why bring me into this? True, I don't have the wits to break the web."
Zhu Bajie,师兄自那次后，情情爱爱的消停多了,But he had torn his way out since that day.
The Old Monkey,八戒，仔细看看，这里很多你的好朋友,"Take a look, Bajie. Can you see? Many of your good friends are here."
Zhu Bajie,酒肉一场，算不得朋友,"We're just fair-weather friends, that's all."
The Old Monkey,酒肉朋友，也是朋友,"But they are still friends, aren't they?"
Zhu Bajie,你说是就是罢,"So you say, so it must be."
Zhu Bajie,这几个老兄弟……似乎没得一个善终啊,These old buddies... I think none of them ended up well.
The Old Monkey,是啊，古往今来的奇才异能之士，何其之多,"Indeed. For ages, countless gifted souls have walked this earth."
The Old Monkey,但真正成就不朽功业的，寥寥无几,"Yet of them, how few have forged everlasting greatness!"
The Old Monkey,你们可知为何？,Do you know why?
Zhu Bajie,世道不公？,Injustice?
The Old Monkey,世道从来不公,Never has it been just.
Zhu Bajie,运气不好？,Misfortune?
The Old Monkey,运气只是强者的谦辞,Fortune is simply humility in the mighty.
Zhu Bajie,那只能是……,"Well, mayhaps..."
Zhu Bajie,没我老猪英俊了,They simply lacked my charm.
The Old Monkey,因为空有天赋，不思进取,"Gifted they may be, yet strive they not;"
The Old Monkey,小富即安，沉迷享乐,content with little and lost in lust.
The Old Monkey,想安逸，又想名利,Seek the ease yet crave the renown.
The Old Monkey,想快意江湖，又想成佛作祖,They yearn for freedom yet aspire to Buddhahood.
The Old Monkey,哪有这样的好事,They always want both.
The Old Monkey,身本多忧，怎可全求,"Yet, nobody can, and nobody should."
The Old Monkey,牛魔王如此，孙悟空也如此,Such was the folly of the Bull King and Wukong.
The Old Monkey,有天命的眷顾，更须有斩断私心凡念的觉悟,Destiny's favor calls for the resolution to sever all desires.
The Old Monkey,你，可记好了,You should mark well these words.
Zhu Bajie,老猴，这不能是师兄的回忆啊，你又弄鬼哄我们,"Hold on. This can't be Wukong's memory. You're fooling us, aren't you?"
The Old Monkey,如今，六根还缺一根,Five of the six relics call for one.
The Old Monkey,八戒，是哪一根？,"Bajie, tell me which?"
Zhu Bajie,眼，耳，鼻，舌，身，意……,"Eye, Ear, Nose, Tongue, Body, and Mind."
Zhu Bajie,意，缺意,Mind! It's Mind!
The Old Monkey,你方才看到了什么？,What did you just see?
Zhu Bajie,我们仨？,The three of us?
The Old Monkey,那就是最后一根,That was the last one.
Zhu Bajie,我懂了，是你！,"I see now, it was you!"
Zhu Bajie,我一早就猜疑，敢莫你才是大师兄的意,I knew it from the beginning! You were the Mind of Wukong all along!
Zhu Bajie,难怪一路引导我们,That's why you led us here.
The Old Monkey,不是我，是他,Not me. It's him.
Zhu Bajie,甚么鬼话，你说他是大师兄？,Don't make me laugh! Him? He is Wukong?
The Old Monkey,是，也不是,"Yes, and no."
Zhu Bajie,我说你个老猢狲，都到这儿了，还含含糊糊卖甚么关子！,"Cut to the chase, will you? We didn't come this far for your riddles!"
The Old Monkey,大圣死后，六根中有五根存留下来，被几个妖王分去,"After Wukong died, five of his six senses endured and were taken by the yaoguai kings."
The Old Monkey,唯独意，没了,Only his Mind was lost.
The Old Monkey,意为六根之首，是每个生命独一无二的本质,Mind is the first of the six. It's the essence unique to every life.
The Old Monkey,正因如此，它注定会随着生命的逝去而陨灭,"Therefore, it's destined to fade away at life's end."
Zhu Bajie,等等,Hold on.
Zhu Bajie,你说大师兄死透了，活不回来了？,"You mean Wukong's gone for good, never to return?"
Zhu Bajie,你个老东西，一直在骗我们！,You old bastard! You've been lying to us all this time!
The Old Monkey,你的大师兄，绝无可能复生了,That Wukong you knew will never return.
The Old Monkey,但他的根本，并没有消疏,But what made him remains.
The Old Monkey,天地也自会再生出一个合适的后辈,"The universe will always bear him a successor,"
The Old Monkey,把那根本连同名号，一起传下去,one who shall carry on his name and nature.
The Old Monkey,这天选的后辈，便是天命人,This chosen successor is the Destined One.
The Old Monkey,你原是无名之人,"Nameless, you were."
The Old Monkey,却在集齐六根的途中，斗了重重艰险，战了许多强者,Yet perils and mighty foes you've braved to recover his relics.
The Old Monkey,淬炼出了足以配得上那份力量的刚强意志,"Your will now stands resolute, worthy of his power."
Zhu Bajie,你是说，让这小猴子顶替我师兄？,You mean this boy is to take Wukong's name?
Zhu Bajie,他配吗！,He's not!
The Old Monkey,孙悟空，早就死了！,Sun Wukong is long gone!
The Old Monkey,八戒，你心里明白，你那师兄，从来没那么圆满,"Bajie, deep down, you know he wasn't all that perfect."
The Old Monkey,孙悟空既已不在，当接过这名号的人，或者是他,"Now that he is dead, this one, perhaps, shall bear the name in his stead."
The Old Monkey,到了，后面我们不便再送，你须独自过去,"Here, we can venture forth with you no further. This task is yours alone."
The Old Monkey,孙悟空死后，留下了一具六根全无的残破骨榇,"Sun Wukong left behind a broken shell, stripped of all his Six Senses."
The Old Monkey,纵然多年过去，那残躯仍有天然灵性，能感应自己生前的气息,"Though ages have passed, it maintains a connection, attuned to the echos of his former self."
The Old Monkey,你若真是天命所归，便去亲手将这具不生不灭无魂无魄的僵尸除去,"If you truly are the one destined, you must cast aside his soulless shell and merge the six into one."
The Old Monkey,从此六根合一，西游重续,"Then, you shall be the one to begin the journey anew."
Zhu Bajie,不成不成！,"No, not on his own!"
Zhu Bajie,他一向木木樗樗的，我不放心，我同他一齐去,He's just a kid who knows nothing. I'll go with him.
The Old Monkey,这个地方，本就是悟空死后残留的执念所化,This place is shaped by Wukong's lingering obsession.
The Old Monkey,这返本还原的最后一关，只有靠他自己,It allows only his relic-bearer to face the final ordeal.
The Old Monkey,你我帮不上忙，不信，你看,We can escort him no more. See it for yourself.
Zhu Bajie,小猴子，好侄子，打不过就跑！,"Hear me, son. You can always run!"
Zhu Bajie,悟空的名头，咱不要也罢！,"Remember, you don't have to bear Wukong's name!"
The Old Monkey,你们一定都听过关于他的故事,You must have heard tales about him.
The Old Monkey,有人说，他帮唐僧取到了真经,"Some say he helped Tang Monk fetch the Scriptures,"
The Old Monkey,封了斗战胜佛，从此留在了灵山,"was granted Buddhahood, and stayed on Mount Lingshan thereafter."
The Old Monkey,也有人说，那个成佛的根本不是他,Some say it was not him who was granted Buddhahood.
The Old Monkey,真正的他，早就死在了西行路上,The real him was already dead on the journey to the West.
The Old Monkey,还有人说，西游从来都没有发生过,Some say that the journey never happened.
The Old Monkey,他只不过是说书人杜撰的一只猴子,He is nothing but a monkey who lives in some storyteller's tall tale.
The Old Monkey,但我要讲的故事，你们一定没有听过,"But now, you will hear a tale which no one has ever known."
Maitreya,见他所见，思他所思,"In his steps, you've trod, from his eyes, you've seen."
Maitreya,你兜兜转转，又回来这里，可有悟到什么？,The circle has led you back. Have you gleaned any truths?
Maitreya,有位故人，已等你许久了,Long has an old friend waited for you.
Maitreya,机缘已到，这最后一幅画，便是答案,Destiny ripens. This last mural holds the key.
Maitreya,去罢，这个故事，没人比他看得更清楚,Go forth. No one sees this myth more clearly than him.
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",山上冷，吃不着什么好酒,"Shame, I must greet you in this bitter cold without a hearty drink."
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",千辛万苦寻到这里，想必不是来陪我解闷的,It's no easy feat getting here—I know you didn't come to keep me company.
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",你心里，一定有过不去的事，或者放不下的人,"In your heart, there must be something you can't get over or someone you can't let go of."
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",我也一样,Same goes for me.
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",我杀不了那只猴子，没人杀得了，除了他自己,"I can't kill that monkey. No one can, except himself."
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",后来我才明白，也许那是唯一的办法,"But at last, I see this is the only way."
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",他没得选,He had no choice.
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",我，也没有,And neither did I.
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",开！,Hyah!
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",小猴子，你果然有几分他的影子,"You do have some of his spark, young monkey."
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",既已如此，我便不再留情，得罪了！,That's it. I won't hold back from now. Let s fight!
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",今日不够尽兴，不如随我先回天上大醉三天，再大战三百回合,Go back with me to the sky. Let us get drunk before we continue this fight!
Erlang Shen,能把我逼到这般模样的，果然还是这只猴子,None has what it takes to push me into this but this monkey!
Erlang Shen,你不在的日子，我每天都在想你,I've been thinking of you every day since.
Erlang Shen,猴子，你还未用过，这般法相罢,Monkey! Such power must be new to you.
Erlang Shen,先与他们，操练操练,You should first spar with them awhile.
Erlang Shen,果真，是个好猴子！,A monkey of worth indeed!
Erlang Shen,既然帮你，便帮到底罢！,"As I've helped you, l shall see it through!"
Erlang Shen,太钝了，与你斗……还是这般费力损刀,Blunt it is. Our battles.... always wear down my edge.
Erlang Shen,这一把，方好陪你！,This one should suit you well!
Erlang Shen,石头，就得……,A rock must be...
Erlang Shen,硬！,Solid!
Erlang Shen,很好,Very well.
Erlang Shen,现在有十分像你了！,Now you resemble your former self perfectly!
Erlang Shen,有能耐，就在此间报仇罢！,"Then if you can, avenge him here and now!"
Erlang Shen,真个是硬,"You are hardy, truly."
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",是他赢了,The win is his.
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",我遣众兄弟一路试你，就是为了这一刻,"My brothers tested you at my behest, all for this day."
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",那一战后，直到今日，我才明白……,And only now do I understand that fight.
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",一世名，锁不住他,No prestige can shackle him.
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",一道箍，困不住他,No band can keep him caged.
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",以肉身之死，换意念永续,A mortal death for an unbound mind and will.
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",但愿你，不会辜负他,May you not fail him.
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",我心结已解，你的路，才刚开始,"I'm now at peace. Your journey, though, has just begun."
Maitreya,若他能从那幅画中出来，这天命又该作何说法？,"Say, what's to come of destiny, if he steps out of that mural?"
Yuan Shoucheng,我不过是个卖卦之人，卦象如何，天命便如何,I make a living by reading what was written; the signs alone tell what's to come.
Maitreya,未来之所以是未来，在于未定,What's to come is what's not yet written.
Maitreya,未定之事，天也难算,No one can read what's not written.
Yuan Shoucheng,天命，即因果,Destiny is written—in what's done.
Yuan Shoucheng,前因既定，谁也逃不脱后果,What's done shapes what's to come. None escape.
Yuan Shoucheng,我算不出来，无非前因知道得还不够多,It's all written for me—if only l uncover all that occurred.
Maitreya,诶，这世上竟有先生算不出来的事情,So there really is something even you cannot read.
Maitreya,好事，好事！,"That's good, very good!"
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",成了佛又如何,What does it matter if you become a Buddhha?
"Erlang, the Sacred Divinity",那道箍，一直都在你头上,That headband has always been on your head.
Sun Wukong,睁开你的狗眼，我这就摘下来给你看！,Keep those eyes wide open. Watch me rip it off and break free!
Buddha,孙悟空，汝因大闹天宫,"Sun Wukong, when you defied the Celestial Court,"
Buddha,吾以甚深法力，压在五行山下,I had to seal you beneath the mountains with my dharma.
Buddha,幸天灾满足，归于释教,"Yet, after enduring punishment, you embraced the dharma,"
Buddha,且喜汝隐恶扬善，在途中炼魔降怪有功，全终全始,"uplifted good against evil, and subdued yaoguais throughout the journey."
Buddha,加升大职正果，汝为斗战胜佛,"For your contribution, now I bestow upon you the title of Victorious Fighting Buddha."
Voiceover,那厮触犯了上天，玉帝立此三事,"He defied the Celestial Court, and the Jade Emperor imposed three ordeals."
Voiceover,只等鸡嗛了米尽，狗舔得面尽，灯燎断锁梃,"Only when the chicken finishes pecking the rice, the dog laps up the flours, and the lamp burns through the key...."
Voiceover,那方才该下雨哩,The rain will fall.
Sun Wukong,哥哥们，饮了这杯，我们一起打上凌霄宝殿！,"Bottoms up, brothers! One final toast before we crash the Celestial Palace!"
Yuan Shoucheng,久在樊笼里，复得返自然,"""Long bound by worldly cage, now free in nature's sage."""
Yuan Shoucheng,路上可曾见到那些无主的孤魂？,Have you seen those nameless souls adrift on your path?
Yuan Shoucheng,灵蕴不散，浮于空中,"Their wills float aloft, never to fade."
Yuan Shoucheng,可惜你的葫芦不中用，我这葫芦又认主,"Shame, your gourd serves little purpose, and mine answers solely to me."
Yuan Shoucheng,我有一法，可超度孤魂，归全反真，于你必有帮助,"I know a way to guide the souls, mend their paths, and set them free. It will aid you."
Yuan Shoucheng,这才像样，不能装天却可度人，荡去痴念，早入轮回,"Now, this is better. This gourd, though humble, may save the lost, banish their obsessions, and guide them."
Yuan Shoucheng,既承天命，自是无法回头,"For one as destined as you, there can be no turning back."
Yuan Shoucheng,你我无非都是这茫茫天地间的蓬草，能往何处去呢？,"We are like tumbleweeds, drifting through life, with a destiny beyond our grasp."
Yuan Shoucheng,盛景易朽，以笔存之,"Fair sights fade. But with ink, I bid them stay. "
Yuan Shoucheng,你已在路上，又如何能停下脚步,The road has claimed you. Now you must see it through.
Yuan Shoucheng,只管任性向前，你我还会再见,Your heart will guide you further. We shall meet again.
Yuan Shoucheng,世人都晓神仙好，惟有功名忘不了,"Their minds yearn to ascend, yet fame still holds sway."
Yuan Shoucheng,古今将相在何方，荒冢一堆草没了,"Their glory fades through time, in tombs of somber gray."
Yuan Shoucheng,分散逐风转，此已非常身,"""Hurled by gales, to and fro, changed from our former glow."""
Yuan Shoucheng,我呀，算准你会来到这里,The signs told me you would come here.
Yuan Shoucheng,天命便是如此，一步一步，有缘有故,Such is destiny. What's done is one step before what's to come.
Yuan Shoucheng,此间藏一珍宝，乃当年泾河老龙王被斩时脱落人间的鳞片，他人无法得见,It houses a treasure that none other can see—a scale shed by the old Loong King of Jing River upon his beheading.
Yuan Shoucheng,小友可否在这黄风岭见过？,"Have you seen it in this ridge, young friend?"
Yuan Shoucheng,当年泾河龙王违抗天命，王帝震怒欲行连坐之罪,"When the Loong King defied the Court, the jade Emperor was set to punish his entire house."
Yuan Shoucheng,吓得那四渎龙神躲藏了起来,"The four sons of the Loong King, deities of the four waters, fled."
Yuan Shoucheng,神仙？神仙又有何异？,Deities? Not even they have control over their destinies.
Yuan Shoucheng,只要染了因果，不过都是盘中餐，池中物,"Once caught in the threads of karma, all are mere offerings on the platter."
Yuan Shoucheng,江河淮济，四渎龙神，生死已定，你我皆然,"Four loongs for the four waters under the sky. Their destiny is sealed, as yours and mine."
Yuan Shoucheng,巧了巧了，天寒遇故友，夫复何求,"Well, well! Refreshing winds and an old friend. I couldn't be happier"
Yuan Shoucheng,来来来，一齐赏雪吟诗,Join me. Snow is the best soil for poetry.
Yuan Shoucheng,唉，看来这茶今天是喝不成,"Well, so much for a quite cup of tea today."
Yuan Shoucheng,莫急，猴兄弟,"Hold it, my friend!"
Yuan Shoucheng,来，先坐下,Sit with me awhile.
Yuan Shoucheng,那怪黑毛赤尻，面相奸顽，可不好捉  ,"Dark furred, devious-natured. Hunting that guai is no simple task."
Yuan Shoucheng,你虽有些粗浅修为，但这极北之地天寒地冻,"You do have some skills, but this land bites with cold."
Yuan Shoucheng,胡乱轻造，性命难保,Lack of readiness could be your undoing.
Yuan Shoucheng,今日既有缘再见，我便教给你一招防身御寒的小神通,"Our reunion is destined, and so is my role to teach you this little trick."
Yuan Shoucheng,我非一般人，此非一般火,"I am extraordinary, as is my flame."
Yuan Shoucheng,以后无论伤了累了冷了，就用棒子在地上画个圈儿,"it shall help you in need, be it injury, weariness or frostbite."
Yuan Shoucheng,凭他甚么虎豹狼虫，妖魔鬼怪，俱莫敢近,"Beasts or yaoguais, none shall dare to draw nigh."
Yuan Shoucheng,但识琴中趣，何劳弦上音,"""Knowing the joy within the play, why chase the notes astray?"""
Yuan Shoucheng,情啊爱啊，不过是白云苍狗，终归都会结满蛛网，重归虚无,"Love and passion are as fleeting as the clouds. In the end, they leave nothing but cobwebs and dust."
Yuan Shoucheng,猴兄弟，破镜难重圆,"A broken mirror cannot be made whole again, my friend."
Yuan Shoucheng,你有空劝劝那位猪长老，可别陷得太深,"Tell Master Pig if you will, that attachments are not to be dwelt upon."
Yuan Shoucheng,本是女中仙，思凡堕九天,"Immortal once, from above. For love, she strayed."
Yuan Shoucheng,作茧缚洞中，人间又一年,"In her webbed prison, through mortal years, she stayed."
Yuan Shoucheng,何以称我情，浊酒且自陶,"""What comfort does this heart implore? A humble drink, its solace I adore."""
Yuan Shoucheng,好酒当配好器,A fine brew deserves a fitting gourd.
Yuan Shoucheng,这个，拿去！,"Here, take this!"
Yuan Shoucheng,牛魔王认了命，可是有人不想认,"The Bull King accepted his destiny, but there are others who refuse to do the same."
Yuan Shoucheng,清官难断家事，你我何必沾手,Family strife confounds even the wisest. Why should we meddle?
Yuan Shoucheng,喝上一壶好酒，忘绝烦恼忧愁,"With a full gourd's draft by my side, let cares drift away into the tide."
Yuan Shoucheng,无有因，头悬市曹何故？,"For what deed, must his head be hung for all to see?"
Yuan Shoucheng,无有因，四渎失管何故？,"For what deed, must the waters they governed roam free?"
Yuan Shoucheng,无有因，诸色惘惘何故？,"For what deed, must all matters not know how to be?"
Yuan Shoucheng,无有因，慈悲颠倒何故？,"For what deed, must mercy's hand sow woe upon thee?"
Yuan Shoucheng,无有因，林隐赤髯何故？,"For what deed, must the red one into the woods flee?"
Yuan Shoucheng,是曰：木生炉烟，雾长雷电，击背而歌，真意自现,"Smoke rises high, from wood afire. Hit the back, let the beats respire, as in mist, thunders conspire."
Yuan Shoucheng,无有因，砂掩骊鬓何故？,"For what deed, must from streams into sands thou flee?"
Yuan Shoucheng,是曰：声振波浑，滩余旧痕，藏战于守，巧便为门,"Resonant waves profound, pulsing through the ground. Evade their might unbound, and victory is surely found."
Yuan Shoucheng,无有因，岸伏青背何故？,"For what deed, must the cyan one onto the shores flee?"
Yuan Shoucheng,是曰：夕照剑辙，万象澄澈，电光朝露，聚散离合,"Evening light on snow, paths clear below. Lightning strikes in flow; all happens before you know."
Yuan Shoucheng,无有因，庙潜黄衣何故？,"For what deed, must the yellow one to the shrines flee?"
Yuan Shoucheng,是曰：细碎沾衣，萦空堕地，犁然寡欲，心动神疲,"In the air they swing, to the earth they bring. With snowflakes cling, spirit may wear thin."
Yellow Loong,算卦的袁先生料事如神，但他一定不会料到……,"For all his foresight, Yuan the Signteller could never have known that..."
Yellow Loong,我化为纹饰，藏于他身……,I've hidden upon his garb as a pattern.
Yellow Loong,先父为成全取经而死，我等无一日不想为先父报仇,"Our sire gave his life to pave the way for the journey, and not a day passes that we do not yearn to avenge him."
Yellow Loong,却无一日不是流离失所，无家可归,"Yet every day we find ourselves adrift, without a home to call our own."
Yellow Loong,没了你，便能了却因果,I'll kill you to unbind our destinies.
Yellow Loong,先父违抗王帝旨意，头悬市曹,Our sire's head was hung when he defied the Celestial Court.
Yellow Loong,我等恐玉帝见罪，拜求袁先生搭救，逃离四渎,We dreaded the Jade Emperor's wrath and pleaded with Master Yuan to help us abscond from our waters.
Yellow Loong,可袁先生说，躲得了一时，躲不了一世,"But he warned us: we might hide for a time, but not forever."
Yellow Loong,终归会有人来取我们的性命,"In the end, someone will come to claim our lives."
Yellow Loong,先生还说，舍身成仁，便是我族世世代代的天命,"He had more to say: Sires to sons, we are destined to die for the righteous cause."
Yellow Loong,我信，但我不认,"I trust him, yet I won't obey."
Yellow Loong,但愿你的命，不是再为这老天作嫁衣,"May your path not, once more, be a mere thread in their grand design."
Yuan Shoucheng,你那三个兄弟，皆已诛服,All three of your brothers have been claimed.
Yuan Shoucheng,不去相会，更待何时？,"If not now, when will you reunite?"
Yuan Shoucheng,缘落缘起，不妨再赌一把……,"Destiny repeats itself, always. Why not cast the die once more?"
Ma Tianba,这可如何是好，如何是好啊,What should I do? I'm caught in a tight spot.
Ma Tianba,过来，别怕，你马哥出身高门大户，不会轻易吃人,"Come closer, and fear not. Noble blood doesn't prey on travelers like you."
Ma Tianba,阁下一看就不是这里的妖怪，莫非也是来拜那黑风大王的？,You don't look like a yaoguai from these parts. Have you come to earn the Black Wind King's favor?
Ma Tianba,听我一言，这黑熊外强中干，靠不住的,Hear me. That bear is but a hollow shell. He can grant you nothing.
Ma Tianba,你还是趁早离了此处才好,Don't waste your time on him.
Ma Tianba,起死复生，金银财宝，都是唬人的，那些个小妖都被骗啦,"He lies about cheating death and even the treasures. His followers are, all of them, deceived."
Ma Tianba,黑风怪好弄把戏，嘴上修真养性，肚里贪婪欺心，我所求之事不敢托付,Black Wind Guai is a sly one. He preaches virtue with a heart full of greed. I wouldn't entrust him with my plan.
Ma Tianba,虽不知阁下为何来此，但定要多加小心,"I do not know why you are here, but you should be vigilant."
Ma Tianba,我此刻心急如焚，需即刻启程，就此别过,"Now, I'm pressed for time. Fare thee well, then."
Ma Tianba,鼠爷爷们，我真是来见你们家大王的！,"Good sirs, I just want a word with your king"
Ma Tianba,错怪了，错怪了！我是来拜见你们大王的！,"This is a mistake. A mistake! With my respect, I quest an audience with your King!"
Ma Tianba,阁下怎会在此？,What brought you here?
Ma Tianba,快走！快走！不用你救！,Go. Leave! I don't need your help!
Ma Tianba,阁下与我十分有缘，黑风山一别，竟还能在黄风岭相见,"Fate binds us, sir. From the Black Wind Mountain to here, we meet again."
Ma Tianba,这帮鼠辈不分好歹，径直将我绑了,Those rats... They tied me up on sight for no reason.
Ma Tianba,打诨说送去什么卧虎寺，腌好了送与大王,Joking they'd prepare me for their king's table!
Ma Tianba,这里的妖怪皆是饿鬼,This place crawls with yaoguais eager for a bite.
Ma Tianba,不过阁下放心，想吃你马哥，没那么容易,"But don't worry. If they bite into me, they'll bite more than they can chew."
Ma Tianba,这黄风岭猫鼠同眠，乱作一团,This place is a jumble of rats and cats—all at each other's throats.
Ma Tianba,黄风大圣却不闻不问，怪哉，怪哉！,And the Yellow Wind Sage keeps silent. How odd!
Ma Tianba,这样的大王谁敢投拜？,Who would swear fealty to such a king?
Ma Tianba,我奉劝阁下，赶紧逃命，此地不宜久留,Best make haste and go. Never linger in a peril such as this.
Ma Tianba,你放心去便是，小小鼠妖，能奈我何？,Just leave. These rats are no match for me.
Ma Tianba,我自有法子逃生,I can make my own way out.
Ma Tianba,你形骸虽瘦，遇上这群饿鬼，也饶不过你,"You are a skinny one, but these rats aren't picky eaters."
Ma Tianba,还是快些逃罢,"Flee, the quicker the better."
Ma Tianba,我大事未了，自会趁机逃生,I won't die here with my task undone.
Ma Tianba,此地人多眼杂，有缘定会再见,There are too many eyes around here. We'll meet again if fate wills it.
Ma Tianba,老友！,My friend!
Ma Tianba,先前在黄风岭一无所获，不得已，只好来求黄眉老佛,Yellow Wind Ridge offered me nothing. Yellowbrow the Buddha was my next plea.
Ma Tianba,来到这小西天拜过了佛爷爷才知，我这一生为他人虚度，少了许多快乐,Only after meeting His Grace in The New West did l see - I wasted my life for others and missed much joy.
Ma Tianba,不走了……,No more journey now...
Ma Tianba,虽说家中大王遭难，可世间福祸不皆是自取？,"My king is suffering, yes. But does one hot weave the threads of one's destiny?"
Ma Tianba,为己活，才自在,Peace is living for yourself.
Ma Tianba,佛爷爷说得对，纵情恣欲，无忧无虑,"His Grace speaks true. Indulge, and you shall be carefree."
Ma Tianba,我……我从没像现在这般快活,"This joy... It's new to me, like never before."
Ma Tianba,想当年，我家大王也曾在佛地修行，连他的孩子也是菩萨的弟子哩,"My king once sought wisdom in such a dharma place. His son, too, was a disciple of a Bodhisattva."
Ma Tianba,如今我皈依佛门，也算是追随大王,Now I too walk on this path. I hope I'm following in my king's steps.
Ma Tianba,我劝老友，就留在此地，你我做个同门可好？,"Say, my friend, why don't you stay here and tread this path with me."
Ma Tianba,可怕！可怕！,Grim and dire is this land!
Ma Tianba,从小西天辗转来到盘丝岭，欲求见百目真人,I came here from the New West for the wisdom of the Hundred-Eyed One.
Ma Tianba,谁知他闭观不见，还把我捉进洞来,But he shut his doors and made me prisoner in this lair.
Ma Tianba,我听说那蜘蛛精大多如狼似虎，可能正需我这般精壮汉子补补元气,Tales speak of these insatiable spider guais. They could use a strong male like me to consume and practice.
Ma Tianba,今日多亏猴兄弟！,"Much I owe you today, my friend!"
Ma Tianba,若非你一路相救，我怕是回不成火焰山了,"Without your help along the way, I would see no more of the Flaming Mountains."
Ma Tianba,猴兄弟可曾听过天命人？,"Ever heard tell of a Destined One, my friend?"
Ma Tianba,说是有位天命人一路打杀，誓要救活孙大圣！,They say he marches and fights on a quest to bring back the Great Sage!
Ma Tianba,我家大王与孙大圣曾是结拜兄弟,The Great Sage and my king once swore brotherhood.
Ma Tianba,大圣陨落后，大王好似变了个人，将我等遣散,"After the Sage fell, the king dismissed every one of us. He became someone not himself."
Ma Tianba,那天命人若真能救活孙大圣，在下也愿助其一臂之力！,"If the Destined One is really the one who can bring back the Sage, he can count on my humble support!"
Ma Tianba,这一路来我到处求人，虽计穷力竭，一无所获，却也想通了,"My plea for aid was met only with silence along this path. But in turn, I've seen through it all."
Ma Tianba,猴兄弟，我已做好打算，求人不如求已,"My mind is made, friend. I shall rely on none but myself."
Ma Tianba,他们不救，我自己去救！,"If none shall aid, I will act on my own!"
Ma Tianba,他日若能在火焰山相逢，定与你饮酒欢会,"Should our paths cross at the Flaming Mountains, we'll toast to our reunion."
Ma Tianba,万万保重,"Now, take great care."
Ma Tianba,住手！,Don't!
Ma Tianba,死便死了，只求死得竭绝,"In death, I desire but a complete and final cessation."
Ma Tianba,能挡住这鬼车，也算值当,My life for the cart's demise. I deem it worthy.
Ma Tianba,若不能救我脱身于阴诡之术，就走罢,"If you can't free me from his evil, you should walk away."
Ma Tianba,生者死之根，死者生之根,"""From death roots life, and from life, death."""
Ma Tianba,我是错信了那妖仙,I should have discerned his malice.
Ma Tianba,既已好言相告，就此别过罢！,"Since I have bid farewell with kind words, you should depart now."
Ma Tianba,我只求死后安宁，不愿做浑噩之鬼，走！,My body has been exploited. I beg you to leave my soul in peace. Go!
Ma Tianba,此刻你强取此鞭，我必魂飞魄散，万万不可,"Take the whip now, and my soul shall scatter. I implore you to stop."
Ma Tianba,苦海无边，唯有放下……,Life has too much agony. I should let go...
Ma Tianba,你不去超度那至阴之躯，我亦无法解脱,I cannot rest in peace before my body is freed from darkness.
Ma Tianba,妖仙已除，我心安矣,I can rest in peace now...
Ma Tianba,这一路，没承想，终是做了鬼……,Never thought I'd die before I'd finished my task...
Ma Tianba,你速速前来，此魂此魄，不久矣,Come forth now as my soul's about to vanish...
Ma Tianba,一念尚存，为的便是等你,It has lingered for you for too long.
Ma Tianba,取走罢！,It's yours now.
Ma Tianba,生死茫茫，大梦一场……,"My journey of life, a fleeting dream..."
The Old Monkey,千重水，万重山，过了黑风第一关,"Across streams, over hills, and through the black wind, your blood has spilled."
The Old Monkey,洪钟响，狼蛇藏，烈火熊熊双目盲,"Wolves howl, snakes wind, flames lick, and the smoke blinds."
The Old Monkey,小妖打得费劲，大怪更是仓皇,"Stumble on the lesser, lame; crash before their betters, shame."
The Old Monkey,如此笨拙痴蠢，如何见得真章？,"With such clumsiness, what destiny do you claim?"
The Old Monkey,螳螂捕蝉，黄雀在后,"As the small fish catches its prey, the bigger lurks behind."
The Old Monkey,黄雀是谁，我看不到,Who is the bigger fish? I can't see it.
The Old Monkey,蝉与螳螂……,As for the prey and the small fish...
The Old Monkey,倒是遍地乱跑,They are swimming everywhere.
The Old Monkey,那和尚乃金蝉子转生，是西方如来佛祖座下第二个徒弟,"In his last life, the monk was Jinchanzi, the second disciple to Buddha in the West."
The Old Monkey,因听经不专，轻慢佛法，被如来贬落凡尘,"Yet, his arrogance led him to disregard the dharma teachings, and as a result, the Buddha cast him down to the mortal realm."
The Old Monkey,夜被火烧是他取经之路的第十一难，后面还有七十难呐……,He was destined to face eighty-one trials throughout his journey. The fire for that kasaya was merely the eleventh.
The Old Monkey,一介凡夫，二百七十岁还不知足，偏要图那一件袈裟,"A mere human blessed with a lifespan nearing three centuries, yet he was never sated. He just had to seize that one kasaya."
The Old Monkey,参禅百年，不敌贪心一瞬,"Centuries of devotion, undone by a moment's greed."
The Old Monkey,到头来，成了个孤魂野鬼，可悲可悲,"In the end, a lost soul became him. How pathetic."
The Old Monkey,好好的守山大神不做，又跑回黑风山做长生的美梦,"A fine guardian for Guanyin he could have been, yet he came back here to daydream immortality."
The Old Monkey,可惜空有贼心，却无贼胆,"Sadly he had the greed, but lacked the pluck."
The Old Monkey,骗得了小妖，骗不过自己,"He could fool his followers, but not himself."
The Old Monkey,他的命，自带上禁箍之时便已注定,His destiny was sealed the moment he donned that band.
The Old Monkey,要说地上什么神仙最多，那便是土地了,"Which deities do most abound upon the earth? The Keepers, surely."
The Old Monkey,官职虽小，人间的事却无所不晓,"Though humble in rank, nothing in the mortal world escapes their eyes."
The Old Monkey,可别怠慢喽，谁知他们背后，又是哪位高人？,"You'd be wise not to spurn their kind, for who knows what powers stand behind them."
The Old Monkey,你风沙里走了这一遭，可曾寻到天尽头的古国？,"With the wind and sand you've endured here, did you reach the forgotten kingdom at the end of the land?"
The Old Monkey,又可曾撞上虎伥坠崖，石头打架？,Did you find the clash of stones and the fall of Tiger's Acolyte?
The Old Monkey,只怕你聋了耳又乱了心,"If you shut your ears and heed only your inner murmur,"
The Old Monkey,越是贪图完满，越是搜不干净,"I fear, the more you yearn for flawless endings, the further you'll stray from the path."
The Old Monkey,鼠与虎，都一样，没天命又不认命,"Rats and cats. Neither grasped their destiny, and yet neither admitted it."
The Old Monkey,小猴子你听，那风里传来的，都是求而不得的声音,"Listen closely, young one, their complaints ride upon the wind."
The Old Monkey,救也救过，罚也罚过,"Spared him, punished him."
The Old Monkey,躲也躲过，藏也藏过,"Avoided him, eluded him."
The Old Monkey,先天一箪食，后天一把灰,"Master's grace taught, deciple's plot sought."
The Old Monkey,八爪金龙又如何，动了凡心，菩萨也要吃亏,His Golden Loong Staff meant nothing once mortal compassions took root. Bodhisattvas too could fall in this way.
The Old Monkey,盘古至今曾见风，不似这风来不善,"""No wind wrought such destruction ere, the Samadhi Wind brought only malice here."""
The Old Monkey,那场风，乱了金刚，惊了罗汉 ,"Vajras and Arhats, before the Yellow Wind shivered."
The Old Monkey,文殊走了青狮，普贤失了白象，弄得三界震颤,"Mounts of Bodhisattvas, a lion cyan and an elephant white, in fear quivered."
The Old Monkey,这般法术高强的孽畜，遇见识人的师父,"A wicked yaoguai of fierce might, followed a discerning master."
The Old Monkey,是他的福分，却也成了他的灾难,"It was his blessing, but also became his curse."
The Old Monkey,寿星牵白鹿，老君骑青牛,"On a white deer, or a green bull, the Celestial Courtiers mount."
The Old Monkey,文殊坐青狮，普贤御白象,"On a cyan lion, or a white elephant, the Bodhissatvas ride."
The Old Monkey,这巨虫……说不准也是哪位的坐骑,This great beetle too could be someone's mount.
The Old Monkey,信什么不好，偏要信妖,"They could have put their beliefin anything, yet they chose a yaoguai. "
The Old Monkey,不尊天道，必降天灾,Those who deny the rules must suffer the wrath.
The Old Monkey,都说妖怪吃人，其实人也吃人，而且吃得更狠,"They say yaoguais prey on men, yet men prey on men too, only more ruthlessly."
The Old Monkey,那小小井底的公平交易，与外面又有何不同？,A fair trade in that tiny well. How does it differ from the trades out in the world.
The Old Monkey,石猴不过自封齐天，那司磬童儿却敢自立宗庙，自封世尊,That stone monkey merely named himself a sage. Yet this altar boy dared to found his own faith and proclaim himself Buddha.
The Old Monkey,亏得你佛心坚忍，勇猛无惧，竟抵住了他的引诱,Your faith is firm and will unwavering. You resisted his lures.
The Old Monkey,那些个星君魔将，高僧大能，一个个乱了性情，坏了道心,All those who were high and mighty found their minds lost and their faith stained...
The Old Monkey,真是因为放不下心中的偶像？,But was it truly because of their devotion to Yellowbrow?
The Old Monkey,你一路迎霜冒雪，可曾嗅到世人痴心破灭的味道？,"As you braved ice and snow, did the stench of shattered ego reach your nose?"
The Old Monkey,一纸敬鼠令，父子反目成仇,An edict for rats turned a son against his sire.
The Old Monkey,他誓不与妖为伍，愤而离家，再也没回去过,"Vowing to draw the line with yaoguais, he left his home in fury, never to return."
The Old Monkey,如今因旧怨落困牢狱，才又念起故乡,"Now an old grudge lands him caged, and he recalls his home at last."
The Old Monkey,可没了故人，又哪有故乡?,"But with loved ones lost, where can one find home again?"
The Old Monkey,雪山大士舍全身求半偈，故能证成佛果,"For half a verse of the ultimate truth, Snow Mountain Ascetic gave his life, so attained Buddhahood."
The Old Monkey,不似这般，怎能当得鼻祖？,Such is the sole way to rise above all and build a faith.
The Old Monkey,天生圣人若不敬天，孤高自傲，任意妄为,If those with talents should proudly scorn the rules and do as they please...
The Old Monkey,那又何来四海升平，三界清静？,How then may all the realms enjoy peace and prosperity?
The Old Monkey,没人知道，他究竟在想什么,Not a soul can fathom his mind.
The Old Monkey,北方有个真武，号荡魔天尊,"Xuanwu of the north, the Vanquisher of Yaoguais."
The Old Monkey,昔年奉玉帝敕旨，剪伐天下妖邪，龟蛇二将乃其左右侍从,The jade Emperor once ordered him to purge the world of evil. The Turtle and the Snake were his generals back then.
The Old Monkey,可惜如今，龟蛇不再能合形，真武徒剩虚名,"Alas, the Snake General can no longer join the ranks, and Xuanwu is no more."
The Old Monkey,西天拜佛，山高路险，除了几位徒弟,The journey entailed an arduous road. The monk had his disciples...
The Old Monkey,还有六丁六甲、五方揭谛,"And the Eighteen Dharma Guardians, the Twelve Zodiac Deities,"
The Old Monkey,四值功曹、一十八位护教伽蓝保守唐僧左右,"the Five Directional Guides, and the Four Temporal Overseers."
The Old Monkey,他们各有神通，你若见到，亦可多加来往,"Each boasts unique powers. Should your paths cross, strike up a connection."
The Old Monkey,本事虽有长进，却还是个夯货,"You have grown in strength, but not in wisdom."
The Old Monkey,这番不但伤了悟能与他的小情人，还毁了人家的大阵，罪过罪过,You've not only hurt Bajie and his darling but also laid waste to the seal of the high ones. A grave misdeed!
The Old Monkey,凡人也好，神仙也罢，都想着戒断过往，重启炉灶,"Mortal or Immortal, all seek to break from the past and start anew."
The Old Monkey,可命运呐，就像爱人的舌头，嘴里一套，心里一套,"Yet destiny, like a lover's tongue, speaks one way and means another."
The Old Monkey,哪怕亲口尝到，也不知到底是想要，还是不想要,"Though you may savor it yourself, you can never tell if you truly want it or not."
The Old Monkey,当年这蜈蚣精被毗蓝菩萨收服，囚在紫云山,"Long ago, the many legged one was subdued by Bodhisattva Pilanpo and locked on Purple Cloud Mountain."
The Old Monkey,是上方求请，方得生还,Only by a plea from the Celestial Court was he spared.
The Old Monkey,神仙做事，多让耳目代劳，本尊坦然自若，如下棋一般,"The Immortals dispatch minions to enact their will, while they remain serene, as if playing a game of chess."
The Old Monkey,可怜那些棋子，他们明明自知是棋子,Pity those pawns! They know full well what they are...
The Old Monkey,却心怀侥幸，甚至以此为傲,Yet they cling to false hopes and even take pride in it.
The Old Monkey,天庭的官职亘古不变,The posts of the Court have stood unchanged.
The Old Monkey,然则神仙之位，却未必总是同一人所居,But the same seat might not always be held by the same Immortal.
The Old Monkey,这些个蜘蛛精亦如是，更迭不休，一代又一代,So too the seven spider guais. They boast an endless procession of generations.
The Old Monkey,料想这位定是东天里的上仙,This one must be a High Immortal from the Court.
The Old Monkey,当年七情迷没、多目遭伤两难中，是毗蓝菩萨出手解困,"Amid the trials of the seven spiders and the many-eyed one, it was Bodhisattva Pilanpo who lent a hand."
The Old Monkey,不曾有天庭协助,No aid from the Court was given.
The Old Monkey,可那孙悟空行事不论规矩，难说他没有去搬别的救兵,But Wukong is ever heedless of rules. He might have sought higher places for help.
The Old Monkey,这大公鸡乃毗蓝菩萨之子，名昴日星官,This rooster is Pilanpo's son. The Dawnstar he was called.
The Old Monkey,当年降伏百眼魔君的绣花针，便是他日眼里炼成的法宝,"Through him is forged the Weaver's Needle, the one that subdued the Many-Eyed Master."
The Old Monkey,毒敌山琵琶洞，他还曾叫死过一只大母蝎子，可谓昆虫天敌,"More than that; he once crowed a giant she-scorpion to death. Indeed, he is a bane to all insects."
The Old Monkey,唉，情丝不斩，哪怕封了净坛使者，也是俗人一个,Even the Sacred Gourmand remains mundane if he clings to the ties of love.
The Old Monkey,从总督天河的天蓬元帅，到福陵山的猪刚鬣,"He was an Admiral of the Court, a pig in the mountains..."
The Old Monkey,再到取经的猪悟能，本性一点没变,And Bajie in the journey. Yet his nature remains unchanged.
The Old Monkey,也罢，做个直肠的痴汉，定能少些烦恼罢,So be it. A guileless fool may know less sorrow.
The Old Monkey,夜叉毕竟是八部战力之首,"Yakshas are the mightiest of the Eight Legions, after all."
The Old Monkey,纵然铁打的筋骨，死个百十回，也合情理,"Be your body hard as metal, meeting death in scores is inevitable."
The Old Monkey,可那小鱼儿小车子，为何也打得这般狼狈？,"Yet, why did you endure the fish and those carts just as poorly?"
The Old Monkey,风风火火，云里雾里，你所见，即是你所愿,You rush like wind with a clouded mind. It's your desires that shape what you see.
The Old Monkey,若不是心神不安，怎会被自作聪明的孩儿所骗？,"Had your mind been less unsettled, would you still have fallen for that child's play?"
The Old Monkey,急之易不暇，缓之或自明,"Haste oft blinds, while patience illumines."
The Old Monkey,下次没了悟能，你还能悟空么？,"Next time, can you still fulfill as Wukong without Bajie?"
The Old Monkey,为降伏牛王，连玉帝都降下旨意,"To subdue the Bull King, the jade Emperor issued an edict."
The Old Monkey,哪吒与他老爹，一个脚踩火轮儿，手拿斩妖剑、缚妖索,"Nezha, with the Incinerating Wheels, the Guai-Slaying Sword, and the Coiling Tether..."
The Old Monkey,一个托着宝塔，身携照妖镜，再会聚一干神仙,"And his father, with the Sealing Pagoda and the Revealing Glass. Combining their strength, they mustered a host of Immortals..."
The Old Monkey,好一番恶战，这才让那牛王勉强认输,who fought the Bull King and narrowly defeated him.
The Old Monkey,孙悟空大闹天宫时，蹬倒了太上老君的炼丹炉,"Amid Wukong's rampage through the Court, he toppled Lord Lao's Pill Furnace."
The Old Monkey,几块内有余火的砖落到此处，化为了火焰山,A few bricks bearing remnant flames fell here and became the Flaming Mountains.
The Old Monkey,老君怪那守炉的道童失守，将他降下人间，做了火焰山土地,"Lord Lao blamed the furnace-tending boy for his negligence, and banished him to become the Keeper of this place."
The Old Monkey,取经前，孙悟空是个遍访英豪，广交贤友的快活人,"Before the journey, Wukong lived free and easy. He wandered the lands and befriended the mighty."
The Old Monkey,他有六个弟兄，牛魔王便是其一,"He had six sworn brothers, the Bull King among them."
The Old Monkey,他俩一个称齐天，一个称平天，可谓是性情相投,The monkey and the bull both called themselves Great Sages. They were two of a kind.
The Old Monkey,至于说分道扬镰，大打出手，都是后话,"As for their parting of ways and hard-fought strife, those are tales for another time."
The Old Monkey,这是积雷山摩云洞玉面公主,That was Princess Fair Fox of Mount Jilei.
The Old Monkey,她有百万家私，又慕牛王神通广大，情愿倒陪，招赘为夫,"Graced with great wealth, the princess revered the Bull King's immense power. She gladly wed him, despite the ill-suited match."
The Old Monkey,他两个过了阵快活日子,The two shared some joyous days together.
The Old Monkey,直到取经一行人到来，玉面公主被八戒打杀,"Until the monk and his disciples came, and Bajie slew the princess."
The Old Monkey,传说两人还生有一女，不知下落,"Stories tell that the two bore a daughter, though her fate is unknown."
The Old Monkey,那牛王倒地之时，回眸一瞬，似已看到了他最害怕的恶梦,"As the Bull King collapsed, he cast a glance behind, as if catching a glimpse of his deepest fear -"
The Old Monkey,红孩儿脚踏战车，领六健将来取他性命,The Red Boy coming to claim his life with the Five Elemental Carts and the Valiant Six.
The Old Monkey,他愿这一天永不到来，却又盼着这一天快点到来……,"He wished this day would never come, yet also longed for its swift arrival."

,你挑着担  我牵着马,In the distant land. we've journeyed afar
,翻山涉水  两肩霜花,Grand lands and lakes witnessed our scars
,风云雷电任叱咤,Lightnings and rains only strengthened our art
,一路豪歌 向天涯 向天涯,"We've kept our words from the start, from the start"
,啦啦啦啦啦啦啦啦啦啦,"La-lah, la-la-lah-la-la-la-la-lah"
,一番番春秋冬夏,Seasons have approached and passed
,一场场酸甜苦辣,"We've come through, unbent though hard"
,敢问路在何方 ,Where lies the path ahead?
,路在脚下,It is right under your feet.
,敢问路在何方 ,Where lies the path ahead?
,路在脚下,It is right under your feet.
,翻过了山 路走不完,"One more mountain, but still the path ran"
,趟过了河 风吹不干,"One more river, with stains left on hand"
,闯过的关 一去不再还,"Odds I've fought against, I can't be back again"
,拥抱过的人 明明忘了 剪也剪不断,"I tried to forget those I once held dear, but I never can"
,取了真经 真假如幻,"The Scriptures are sound, yet still lost I stand"
,封了神佛 神思难安,Still I stay restless despite the title they grant
,成了大道 大地凋零依然,"Fulfilled I am, but the world remains a foul land"
,得了千秋功名 千千万生灵涂炭,"My glory and fame, paid by lives countless as the sand"
,故事被谱成曲 全是分合聚散,"They sing about my tale, about the partings, the pain"
,曲唱成歌 最怕平凡,For what's to be heard if there's nothing grand?
,群生万物 本来皆成善,All beings in the world were kind as they began
,名注齐天梦一般,"My days of glory, a dream once at hand"
,英雄被写成诗 只剩爱与勇敢,"In the poems, only our love and valor remained"
,诗凝成画 少了悲欢,"A moment of art, with no sorrow to find"
,你我原是 无拘无束身,You and I were once free and untamed
,天不收来地不管,No one cared where we ran
,肉化成土 埋葬背叛,Soil of flesh buried the traitors' plan
,骨烧成灰 涂抹苦难,Dust of bones masked the pain in sand
,血兑成水 淹没所有呐喊,Streams covered blood and agony in kind
,精魂炼成了丹 从此尝不出辛酸,"They took my remains, and the story passed to no one"
,故事被谱成曲 全是分合聚散,"They sing about my tale, about the partings, the pain"
,曲唱成歌 不许平凡,For it's banned to hear if there's nothing grand
,群生万物 本来皆成善,All beings in the world were kind as they began
,名注齐天梦一般,"My days of glory, a dream once at hand"
,英雄被写成诗 只剩爱与勇敢,"In the poems, only our love and valor remained"
,诗凝成画 不容悲欢,"A moment of art, there's no sorrow to find"
,你我原是 有情有欲人,You and I were once beings of passion
,天地不平心不甘,There are things we won't stand
,他们被说成书 区区八十一难,"The journey became myth, like a game with plans"
,书刻成碑 光明灿烂,"A pillar, they say, both true and grand"
,试问有谁 再打破顽空,Who else is there to shatter all our bounds?
,不堕轮回万古传,"To be beyond, to be the one?"
