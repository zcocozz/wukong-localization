Qwen
"Man, I've got you."
I have obtained it.
"I, Sun Wukong, don't care about any fame or glory, I just want to return to this Flower-Fruit Mountain and live out my days in peace and freedom."
"The Heavenly King above doesn't trust me, I understand."
Let you bring some shrimp soldiers and crab generals to make a show of strength.
"You're trying to scare me back into being a god, and I understand."
I don't understand is...
"You bastard, kill my monkey grandchildren!"
"Stupid dog, dare you to defy me, get out of here!"
"Remember, he's not just an ordinary monkey, he's a monkey with merit."
Have you ever heard of a monkey named Sun Wukong?
Only I am worthy to challenge him alone here.
"Monkey, monkey, I didn't want to fight you again, the loser."
"Alright, if you lose, I'll take you back to heaven."
"They, staying here, flattening Flower Fruit Mountain."
"If I lose, I will not give up."
"They, just like that, flattened Flower Fruit Mountain."
"It's a mess, but we were colleagues after all, I really don't want to fight."
"How about you kneel down right now and apologize, and let this matter go, okay?"
"So many years have passed, and among all the characters, only you are the most skilled at talking nonsense and the most able to make Old Sun happy."
"Brother Yang, don't worry."
"I'll only pull out the eye on your forehead to taste it, and the other two will be saved for you."
I'll let you see with your own eyes how I slaughtered every dog in the Heavenly Court.
"Here, above, and the black one just now."
Let's go for it!
The heavens have given you opportunity after opportunity.
"You are so ungrateful, is that considered betrayal of trust?"
The Victorious Fighting Buddha...
Do you know how many people have been unable to obtain this immortality Buddha position?
Immortality...
"The three realms and six paths, isn't it all destroyed by these four words?"
"Monkey, you have been marked by the Heavenly Seal, and your nature has not changed."
No one can save today.
"Good brother, your sword is dull?"
"Just give me a scratch, my old master..."
"Monkey, eat my blade!"
"Little nephew, is this what you were talking about?"
"The sun is blinding in the sky, it's like going to the mountains to meet your uncle again."
This is the last story of Sun Wukong.
"He was a man of great courage, and he most enjoyed living freely and without restraint."
"Even if one attains the true fruit of the golden body, they still cannot bear the complexity of the celestial laws."
I'm always thinking about coming back here and having fun with you.
"Who would have known that he would resign from his position as a Buddha and return to his hometown with joy, and some people were even more worried than before?"
"This stone, it has been standing in the mountain for an unknown number of seasons."
I've heard since I was young that the body of the Great Sage Equal to Heaven is hidden inside.
"He is a natural stone monkey, with the great power of immortality and non-aging."
"Even if I die, my soul will not completely dissipate."
"Instead, they transformed into six divine artifacts"
This is the legend of the Great Sage's six senses.
"Alas, for centuries, no one has ever seen it with their own eyes."
"I am old, and I cannot traverse this vast land of four continents."
"But among you, there may be one who is destined to be the chosen one."
Search for all the spiritual objects he left behind.
"When all the spiritual beings have returned to Flower-Fruit Mountain, or when the Great Sage is reborn..."
"Let's go, let's go, let's swim, let's swim."
I am willing to be a horse or a cow for a copper coin.
Being human is better than being a demon.
Fear not the阎王's fate.
"Hey, look at that."
"When the time is right, good fortune will come naturally."
Big brother really has a good mouth.
It might have rolled down from some mountain.
I'm hungry.
This peach is quite sensible.
What a little monkey!
Dare you mess with my grandfather?
"Today, I will make you know the power of my strength!"
No matter how many times you come.
I can't seem to change this impulsive nature.
What are you staring at?
Pull a hair and worship it.
"Hey, wait a minute!"
"The little god is the land of Black Wind Mountain, waiting for you for a long time."
Like
It's true.
"Continue walking, and you will reach the Guanyin Temple."
It was also a time of great prosperity in terms of incense offerings.
"Alas, that great fire..."
"Later, the temple was rebuilt."
"If the heart is burned out, it can be difficult to recover."
What good is it to fix up a dilapidated temple?
You don't remember this place.
There is something here that is keeping an eye on you.
"The one who comes is not good, little monkey, seek your own good fortune!"
It has been a long time since I've used it.
I didn't expect this immobilization technique to be so effective.
It's an old friend from Flower Fruit Mountain.
It's okay to teach you a trick.
"Come on, hurry up and put your hand out!"
Wrote it down.
"In the future, if you encounter any bandits or evil people."
All you need to do is point with this hand.
"Whisper to yourself ""calm down"
It can immobilize the opponent.
You can take a break for a moment.
It's just that the old man's skills are limited.
This immobilization effect will wear off in no time.
It's still useful against some stubborn opponents.
You can consider it as a means to earn a living.
Nowadays these little ones
How dare you speak to me like that!
"Don't be afraid, play with him using the spells you just learned!"
"If you continue to charge forward without understanding the depth and breadth of the situation, you will only bring harm to yourself and others."
I'm afraid you'll have to take a big hit.
I will turn you into a golden cicada.
You can follow the light in front.
Let's see what's going on in this mountain.
The small temple has many magical uses.
You will understand it in the future.
The back mountain of Black Wind Mountain hides many secrets.
"If you want to explore around,"
Be sure to pay attention to the duration of the Golden Cicada's existence.
If you encounter a place where there is no way out
The little god will give you some hints in secret.
Go ahead and relax!
Who are you?
Dare you come here to disturb my quiet meditation?
"Eh, another monkey?"
"Brother, why don't you put down your staff?"
Let me teach you some Buddhist teachings.
How are you?
You... are you the one the king spoke of...?
Heaven... destiny... man
Shh! Don't make a sound.
Be careful not to disturb that big dog.
The guy in the backyard is the friend of the Black Wind Demon.
I am known as the Spirit of the Void.
"With your current level of cultivation, you might..."
Oh no!
"Little monkey, run away quickly, there's still time!"
"If you enter this door, you will never be able to turn back!"
You underestimate me.
"Since we've killed it, let's turn this place upside down first."
The Black Wind Demon gave Ling Xu Zi a golden pill.
"If we find this item, it will be worth the trip."
My Buddhist name is Guangmu.
If I die in your hands today
Please tell my master that I will be back soon.
"Mortals with ordinary eyes, seeking for the bones of immortals"
"One day of ascension, the celestial realm is free and easy."
"Master, you are so attached to external things."
What's the difference between me and my master?
What's the plan?
Wu Zhi?
The little god remembered!
The evil monk who incited Jinchi Elder to set fire to burn down Tang Seng and his disciples many years ago.
It's them!
I thought these two people had been reduced to ashes and smoke in that fire.
"Who knows that not only did they not die, but they also turned into two monsters, a wolf and a snake."
The little god has a bad feeling.
"After the bell rang, the resentment on the back mountain seemed to be even stronger..."
"Forget it, forget it, what's the point of thinking about it so much?"
"Now, big and small demons in the mountains know that you have entered."
Let's just finish them off in one go!
"You, you, you, what are you doing just standing there?"
"Hurry up, help your brother, quickly beat him with a stick."
"Little snake demon, nothing special."
"The gallbladder of a snake is used to make wine, which is a good medicine for clearing heat and detoxifying."
"Come on, little brother, come in, come in."
"Look, look, you look like a monkey from Flower Fruit Mountain, I've seen many of them."
"In terms of seniority, you all have to call me ""ancestor""."
"However, it doesn't matter, who made me be exiled."
"During the time of the lower realm, I collected quite a few treasures. Take a look, is there anything you like?"
"Little brother, remember, one part drunk, ten parts drunk German."
"Who cares about the elixir of immortality, the milk of the gods, or the nectar of the gods? Let's drink it all up!"
"Where there is wine, there is a heaven for gods; where there is no wine, the celestial palace is like a prison."
"Phoenix, Phoenix"
What is the decline of his virtue?
It is impossible to change the past.
It's never too late to turn back.
"Little master, it's getting late."
You come to my place of cultivation and start killing.
What is your true intention?
Wait a moment!
"It was my big brother who sent me here to be an informant, so I pretended to obey the bear and guarded the back mountain pass."
"I know that your fate is not fortunate, and we share the same illness and concern."
"The Guanyin Chan Temple was burned down, but the spirit of the old monk did not disperse."
"Greed never ends, and the bitter tree remains."
"The thing you truly want, it's best to forget it."
Have you seen those three bells?
"What is it that others are always thinking about, and what is it that you are always seeking?"
Zhong...?
"Since the Black Wind Demon returned, three large bronze bells have been erected in the mountains, but no one is allowed to approach them."
Could it be that the three bells are related to the burning of the Chan Temple many years ago?
"This person's words don't sound like lies, little monkey, you should keep your eyes open."
Amitabha
"Finally, the three huge bronze bells rang."
"My disciples, there are more old men coming from outside."
Bring me new treasures!
I can't see the appearance.
But I can smell that stench.
Could it be you?
You're back?
It must be that you hid the robe.
Give it back to me quickly!
I am 270 years old this year.
He spent hundreds of robes in vain.
How did he get this one?
"No, no, no."
Wu Zhi Wu Mou
"I don't want that robe anymore, no more..."
"Don't burn, don't burn..."
Fireproof罩!
The divine artifact that the Great Sage borrowed from the King of the Broad-eyed Gods many years ago is still here.
You must have surpassed that person.
"Ah, the cycle of cause and effect."
Just because I looked at it once.
"It's getting late, let's go up the mountain quickly!"
Five hundred years.
I rebuilt the Guanyin Temple.
The scale is larger than before.
Those who perished in the fire
Turn into a ghost wandering aimlessly
Roaming around in this Black Wind Mountain.
It's me!
Guide them to the other side with your own hands.
I even have those scroll fragments.
Restore one by one
But I know there will be a day when
You're still going to come looking for me!
Has some skills.
Come with me to the top of the mountain and we'll see who's stronger!
His technique of gathering form and dispersing energy.
Looking at the flashy flowers
It's actually not difficult to master.
This Black Wind Demon is not skilled in his art.
I went to the South Sea and didn't see any progress.
His recent transformations
There are still a lot of spiritual energy left here.
"Perfect, I'll take some for myself!"
"Shapeless and formless, leaving no trace."
There's a lot to learn inside.
Let's just let it be for now.
"Little monkey, the road ahead is dangerous, don't forget the spells you just learned when it's crucial!"
That guy used to tell me
"Out of sight, out of mind, ordinary cultivation,"
"Enter all phenomena, break all phenomena, and only then can you achieve freedom."
But he saw those things himself.
Aren't you crazy too?
The little imp has some tricks up its sleeve.
"Today, this great king will not bother you!"
This time is different from the past.
No one is helping you.
Wait for me to take this treasure.
Where can't we rebuild the temple?
The Great Sage
"Oh no, little saint."
"Little Saint, please spare me! Little Saint, please spare me!"
I was also coerced by the Heavenly Court that day.
If not for being unable to control oneself
Who dares to lay a finger on the god of the Heavenly Palace?
The bear demon said it wasn't a lie.
"Even if you had the courage to borrow, you wouldn't be able to do it."
He would never dare to harm the Great Sage himself.
There must be someone else behind this.
"Besides, it's pretty weird."
"After obtaining it, I had"
It had to be placed high up above.
It's just a small trick to get some small monsters to worship and make some money.
If the little saint forgives me this time
I will return to the South Sea to apologize with a bundle of cypress branches.
Re-wear the Restraining Band
"From now on, I will never leave Putuo!"
Don't listen to him ramble!
"Little monkey, hurry up and take back the relics of the Great Sage to have a look."
"Master, the disciple still doesn't understand."
"Monks have severed their worldly ties, and the golden sea has dried up."
Why did the elder insist on keeping a piece of clothing?
If you don't put on this robe
"How could the common people know that my dust has been severed, and the golden sea has dried up?"
"Huangfeng Ridge, 800 miles long, was once a prosperous land outside the border."
"A sudden outbreak of rats, leaving behind a haze of smoke and no trace of people."
"Without father, without ruler, without law, doing wrong and evil with divine protection."
"Thanks to the Great Sage's divine power, the evil winds were temporarily subdued."
Little did he know that an unexpected disaster would strike at any moment.
That yellow-haired demon animal returns to its home.
"The criminal who does not die is very happy, but the corpse of the lucky star remains a mystery."
"Little disciple, the purpose of your coming here, the old monk has guessed a little bit."
"Haste makes waste, let me help you for now."
"Be careful on the road, or you'll end up with a hole in your body and no one to save you."
"Blood turns into wind, sand turns into rain, and the stray cat and mouse play together."
"Whether you win or lose, don't talk about it. If you don't follow the right path, there's no point in trying."
"What a ruthless and cunning monkey!"""
"Poor mouse demon, he's been wandering the underworld for so long."
As a professional game localization expert for Black Myth:
"I have hands but no head, and I am empty for a long time."
Under heaven
"Father-son, ruler-subject, norms and rules, and natural law."
"Which one counts, which one is ignored?"
You see that rat is speaking humanly.
"How did it come to this that the son is dead, the father is fleeing, and the bones are cold?"
"Everyone loves to play for the sake of winning, but the door is always closed."
"The divine wind technique conceals the sun and moon, and the three mysteries of the Dharma obstruct the mountains and seas."
"To see the yellow-haired rat demon, you must have the"
One is not enough to make a pair.
That wind demon with the shriveled egg will not die without being injured.
"Wait, wait, wait, if you keep going, you'll be headless."
"Don't worry,"
"Very clever, very clever"
"I'm glad I've been saving it, I've finally found the right person for it."
"There is no birth, there is no death, and there is no strong desire. The Dharma of convenience is a nightmare for ghosts."
"Others may think it's a rare treasure, but it's not something that belongs to the left-hand path or the outcast."
"The golden iron strikes the stone with no strength, and the Great Sage and Tianpeng are both defeated by the tiger."
"A gun, a knife, a sword, and a halberd, none of them can avoid it. The stone monkey is like you, or not like you."
"Little disciple, your bones are clear and unique, perfectly matching this copper head and iron arm."
Just in time.
I have a prescription that was swallowed by a small frog in the water.
"Don't rush off, help the little god, you won't be cheated."
Very good! Very good!
"People follow the earth, the earth follows the sky, the sky follows the way, and the way follows the natural order."
Go!
"This is a common item, give it to you."
"From now on, you can go to the temple to make your own."
"The little god still needs to find a furnace, so I'll leave first."
"Stay away, stay away."
"You, hurry up!"
Don't stick your head out here.
"If those two-headed monsters see us, we're both going to be in trouble."
We have suffered so much that we have been forced to leave our homes and wander.
"I originally wanted to follow the Rat God to rebuild the empire, but..."
"I saw his subordinates, the vanguard, eating..."
"I'm so confused... It's too scary, I need to escape."
The two-headed rat is one of our country's elite...
It's ridiculous that colleagues have to fight each other.
"Hiding here will eventually lead to starvation, so let's fight our way out and have a decisive battle!"
"How are you still here? Don't let me be discovered, hurry up and leave."
I will never do something like killing my own brothers and sisters.
"You helped me get rid of my colleagues, and it's time for me to leave now."
"My king is stubborn and refuses to listen. If we continue like this, how can we talk about reviving the kingdom?"
Must find the whereabouts of the missing third prince.
"Three prince? Forget it, he hates mice the most!"
"We're in this state now, the third prince won't recognize us, won't recognize us..."
"I, the king, worship the rat, and the third prince was dissatisfied and left home."
There was once a Chinese traveler who traveled to the four corners of the earth and said that he had seen him in the Western Buddhist Kingdom.
Where is that Western Paradise of the Buddha?
"Son, you've been through a lot of hardships."
"As a father, how could he not know?"
The king has not left the valley for a day.
We'll have to wait another day.
Only by enduring can one survive.
"The other day, the boys went to explore the temple again."
"The smell is even worse than before, and there are bones scattered all over the ground."
"It doesn't look like a person, a cow, or a sheep, but it's about the same size as us."
"This damn furball, if the king finds out, he'll never let it go!"
"Shh, shh, you're a melon seed!"
Revitalizing a major project requires careful planning.
It's just a pity for your brother...
What flavor is it?
It's a two-legged sheep!
Is there any fresh meat delivered here?
"Damn monkey, don't you know that our country has a decree to respect rats!"
Remember when we followed the Great King and how glorious it was.
It's pitiful that even a thief monkey can't be defeated now.
"My lord, please don't close yourself off!"
"Help us subdue the giant insect, and then help us subdue this thief monkey!"
Damn commoners! Damn commoners!
The common people are rebelling!
"Crush you, you traitor!"""
I don't know which demon used magic to trap me in this stone.
Even the rocks on the ridge have become spirits.
"There's a stone spirit in that cave over there, and it must have some secrets."
"Once I understand the situation, I can get out of it."
"The stone has become a spirit, this is no small matter."
"You're really easy to fool, I've finally got my hands on this treasure!"
Why haven't you left yet?
Are you really thinking about taking back this treasure? You're not ashamed of yourself!
"Hurry up, your abilities are not great, but your greed is quite strong."
"Get out, you're not ashamed!"
"You son of a bitch, you don't know how to appreciate beauty, and you insist on challenging me!"
Your head is about to be shattered!
"Please spare my life, please spare my life!"
Are you still wanting the treasure?
"Lai pi, you have no shame!"
"So, I can't give it away for free either."
Come back later and bring the essence of the spirit.
"Don't worry, I also need to prepare, right?"
"Damn, why is it so late again?"
Put down the things and hurry back to give birth.
"If I'm late again next time, it will delay the progress of the king's training."
I'll personally wash your stupid son and send him in!
Has that old pumpkin come yet?
"You're a little monk with a crooked face, where did you come from?"
"Who cares, I'll try it first!"
"Take him, and I'll give you my son."
Reaping what you sow...
Regret not... back then...
"A lifetime of martial arts training, and yet..."
"Little monkey, I'm here."
"Rattle, shake it"
Have you seen my father? Where did my father go?
"Father said, ""When the wind and sand disperse, the illness will be cured."
You look like a stranger from another land.
"Don't frown, it's so much fun here!"
"There is an old man hiding in a rock, and there is a pig stealing wine in the village."
And there's something at the bottom of the well...
Ah! I won't tell you!
"Oh, it's so scary! Everyone is surrounding me."
They all said that it was the father who brought the people in the village to be eaten by the monster.
You're lying to me! I don't believe you!
"Hey? You're really good, how did you know I was here?"
This place only my father and I know.
"I'll tell you a secret, I have a good friend who helps me with my illness, and he lives below."
"It's been a while since I've been here, and I don't know if he's healed his own injuries yet..."
Come down and play with us too!
"Dog hearted scum, dare you to continue to serve under the Yellow Wind Demon with the name of the Tiger General?"
Brothers? I'll take my revenge on them sooner or later.
Hmm?
"The father of that child ran away, and he was worried that no one would bring food to him!"
"I can't beat you, but I can't... kneel down"
"Raise your cup and ask the sky, who among the past and present has not died?"
"Not good, missed the main thing..."
Go find someone to cure us of our hangover...
Two more barrels of wine from Dingfengzhuang.
Refreshing and invigorating.
Is it you who woke me up? Thank you.
"However, we are currently empty stomachs, so we cannot accompany you."
We need to eat now.
"They say there's meat to be had at Wutujing Temple, so I think we should check it out."
"Eat your fill and sing your heart out before you start working, for an empty stomach is no good."
"You skinny ghost, you should eat more. Come on, let's go to Wohu Temple."
These rotten rat meat is eaten like biting berries and swallowing needles.
Fury fills us!
How about you find us some good things to eat?
"Old man, I'm craving that lotus root so much. In this dry place, can I find it?"
It's not a bad idea to eat vegetarian food occasionally.
There's a bit of progress on the matter.
"That golden country, is really related to this barren land."
"The legend of the Golden Kingdom is said to be the place where the sun sets into the sea, and the people there worship the rat."
"I don't know how, but this country disappeared later, it's very strange."
"We tried some of those rat demons and rat monsters, and they tasted like they had a bit of human flavor."
"The ancient people of that country were not completely wiped out, and the mysterious disappearance of the Yellow Wind Demon may be related to it..."
"Before coming, my big brother gave me a gold coin, saying that it would be useful at the time."
"It's time, let's go back to our old place and give it a try."
"The golden coins given by my big brother, why are they in your possession?"
Take it!
Good skills! It's satisfying!
That's great! Shall we go to the ancient country together?
"People of today cannot see the moon of ancient times, but the moon of today has once illuminated ancient people."
"You see, whether it's the Golden Kingdom or the Land of the Setting Sun, they no longer exist."
"It is said that in the vast sea of sand here, there once slumbered an ancient giant insect."
"This giant insect sleeps underground all day, leaving no trace."
"Once awakened, it will emerge and devour humans and animals."
"It's just that its shell is as hard as a rock, and ordinary knives, bows and arrows cannot penetrate it easily."
"Traders and travelers dare not approach, and the small countries around it are suffering greatly."
"It happened that a yellow-haired marmot descended to the mortal realm and passed by this place, sensing that the giant insect had an immeasurable Buddha's power on its body."
So he cast a spell to subdue the giant insect and make it his servant.
The king of the small country was overjoyed and made the mouse demon a guardian deity of the country.
Build temples and statues for him and worship him for generations.
"Rat demon's cultivation is convenient, so he decided to stay."
"Later, the Rat Demon's divine power was complete, and he kidnapped the Tang Monk and fought with the Monkey King on Huangfeng Ridge..."
"For a moment, the wind and sand obscured the sun, and the sun and moon were invisible..."
"That rat demon's wind attack was truly formidable, and if it weren't for the intervention of the Bodhisattva of the Golden Elixir, the True Scripture might have been difficult to obtain."
"It's just... without the rat demon in charge, the ancient kingdom is bound to fall into the hands of destruction."
And the originally beautiful Yellow Wind Ridge has become like this today...
Wait a moment.
"Just passing through, go back where you came from, and if you go any further, you'll lose your life."
"I am the advance guard of the Yellow Wind King's army, and I am now on patrol in the mountain as per the strict orders of the King."
"In this sea of sand, there is a monster that is causing harm to the people."
"My lord is about to subdue that monster, so common people are not allowed to enter擅自进入。"
"If any fool dares to enter, disturbing the king's ritual, I can't take the responsibility."
"You don't know how to fight, I'll make you a case of wine for the king!"
"Your stick is really fierce,"
I dare to ask for the help of a high-ranking person to help my king subdue the demon.
"My lord came from the Ling Shan mountain, and he could not bear to see the suffering of the people here, so he stepped in to defeat the demons."
"However, the demon is not easy to deal with. If you are willing to help, it will definitely be twice as effective."
"The king is right in front of us. My cultivation is still shallow, so I cannot go there. Please, please hurry and go to the high-ranking person."
"To be honest, there are two children in my cave who are not yet adults, and I cannot let them die here."
The Yellow Wind King is a kind-hearted disciple of the righteous path from Lingshan Mountain.
"Don't worry, go and make a good karma."
Did the Tiger Vanguard fail?
I'm sure you have some magical powers.
I don't know what kind of treasure the monster has on its body that is in conflict with me.
Even the Three-Quarters Wind could not harm him in the slightest.
"To lure that monster out, we must use the method of beating drums."
"I beat the big drum, calling out the giant insect."
"If you are willing to go, when the time comes, take his treasure."
I can cast a spell to subdue this demon.
The method of beating drums was originally invented by the people at the end of the world to resist the sound of
"The sea boiled, and the sound was so loud that it could kill the children in the city."
"The method of beating the drum solved this difficulty, but it also attracted monsters."
"It has a treasure to protect itself, and I have no choice but to do so."
"You have the courage to come, please lend me a hand."
"That monster is in the sand sea below, please help me subdue this demon and save the people of this place."
The entire city's citizens are grateful beyond words!
"Where there is a saint, there is a thief."
"There are mountains, there are abysses."
"There is a great difference between heaven and earth, and there is bloodshed and chaos."
I can't escape.
"You, you can't escape."
"Sinner, sinner."""
You stole the heart method of Erlang and took away the root of the Great Sage.
I also need the head of the master...
Just for a moment of pleasure in this Yellow Wind Valley?
Amitabha
"Little disciple, I am the master of Mount Little Sakyamuni, and my name is Lingji."
It was also the guard of this rat demon.
"After the Great Sage's death, his six roots did not extinguish and scattered throughout the world."
"This thief rat secretly found one of them, but his own cultivation was limited."
"It was difficult to refine, so he had bad intentions..."
I was caught off guard by his attack and my head was also cut off by him.
It is a container for storing the root vessel and practicing evil techniques.
"Along with the destruction of life in Huangfengling, it is my fault."
"This time returning to the path of righteousness, it all depends on the wisdom and courage of the devotee."
There should only be one person in this world who is worthy of preserving this object.
"Come on, help me put it away."
Human or animal
"Buddha, demon"
"All beings have their own roots and capacities, and they are ranked according to their superiority and inferiority. It is not appropriate to disrupt this order."
"You said, right?"
"The Monkey King"""
"Eat vegetarian food, chant sutras, and meditate."
"There are also a few who are truly calm and untroubled, and who live in peace and tranquility."
You look at you.
"In this strong wind and heavy snow, we still have to work so hard."
It must be for that thing too.
I had a fortune-telling before you came.
Guess what it says.
"Movement is not as good as stillness, and talent without fate."
"If you want to die, I won't stop you."
The deity of Xiaoxitian welcomes the chosen one with respect.
Change!
Have you seen the small temple in the lake?
"Inside, there is what you want."
"Take it while the owner is away, don't linger."
"Hey, is it a god or a demon that's come here?"
"You little brat, you're such a"
"Newcomer, I advise you to stay quiet."
This place is dangerous and you can die if you wander around.
"Reciting scriptures and chanting spells, the sound rises and falls, and people's minds become chaotic."
"You, you can't escape either."
"Why not be like me, not listening or watching, and wait to die peacefully here?"
"When I left, I knew this day would come."
"You, this demon, dare to make a fool of yourself in front of the Buddha!"
"Human is not human, demon is not demon, it's better to die than to live in pain."
It's you... you're still alive.
He also killed my subordinate generals and opened this door.
"My subordinates have four generals, all of whom have lost their minds."
"If you are truly the chosen one, can you help them escape?"
Huangmei disguised as Moli and tricked us to come here for the banquet.
"If it weren't for my foolishness at the time, I wouldn't have harmed my brothers and sisters."
"Poor four generals, reduced to the status of eagles and dogs of demons."
"I cut off my ears and eyes to preserve my true self, so as not to be disturbed by evil words and sounds."
"Huangmei Old Monster, you miscalculated."
This monkey may truly be the chosen one.
"Huangmei obtained the root of the Great Sage, with a big ambition beyond the past."
"With a sense of self-importance and arrogance, you may have a chance to take advantage of it."
"Catching mist, grabbing wind, capturing water spirits, capturing dragons, subduing tigers, and stabilizing the mountain field."
Fame spreads far and wide?
I can't save anyone.
"Thank you for bringing them back, they no longer have to suffer from the torment of the heart demon."
"I left home at a young age, and I once boasted that my destiny was predetermined."
"But now, it's in this state"
Even my brothers who followed me did not have a good end...
"This is of no use to me,"
It's time to go home...
The general still refuses to submit?
"Hold on for a little longer, or you might turn into pus and blood."
"Good sister, it's very cool inside."
I'm waiting for you to come in and practice together with me.
The general laughed it off.
"If you let go of your attachment, I will naturally persuade the master to release you."
"At that time, we can cultivate the Way together."
I can't take it.
"It seems that the old thief has obtained the master's belongings, and his strength has indeed increased significantly."
"Even you, a small official from the Eastern Heaven, have been tamed and obedient."
"However, by the sound of it, the Tianming people have stopped the prayer wheel at the base of the tower."
"Good sister, it seems that this golden lump won't wait for your master to come and open it."
"This Golden Spatula is a treasure of the Sage, how can a small mortal break it?"
You... You awakened the turtle general?
How do you know it's him down there?
What kind of snake or turtle is it?
I just smelled a stinky smell.
"This smell is so familiar, I can't help but beat the drum to welcome it!"
"Master, you are sparing my life because you value my nature, and you have given me a chance to clear my mind in the bottom of the Pagoda."
Neither did he recognize the situation...
The paradise of Little West Heaven is probably not for you.
"Master, you were right. Monkeys are the most stubborn..."
"It's no problem, you can't open this gold!"
"Ammianhua shishini, tuotuolala!"
I've been in there for so long that I'm starting to get pickled.
Get out of the way!
I spit on you!
A woman who is neither human nor ghost.
"Do you not remember when we were in heaven, I never looked at her with a straight face?"
It's the same old thing again.
"With a hairy face and eyes, a sharp mouth and a narrow face, he relies on his luck to survive."
"Another mute, let's just forget it, the important thing is the main business."
"This old turtle, I have a bit of a relationship with him."
He is the Yellow Eyebrow Old Monster.
"The old monkey on Flower Fruit Mountain specially invited me to handle it, for fear that you would fall into his trap."
"He told me that as long as we gather the six pieces, we can save the big brother."
I'll believe him for now.
"I'll go and catch up with old friends first, and you can check around."
"Turtle brother, you've been stuck in this godforsaken place for so many years, it's been tough on you."
Don't worry.
"Once we reach the shore, I'll go up and smash that little temple first."
I will avenge you and your snake brother.
"Steady, steady"
I understand.
"In this world, it's better to be a stone than to live or die."
"You, you've grown so old, and you're still crying and wailing like this."
"I know, I know, don't cry."
"Wait here, I'll go see how your brother is doing."
"This must be the snake general of the turtle and snake duo, and he has already turned into a skeleton."
The Yellow Eyebrow Demon's methods are truly cruel.
"Brother, the snake general has entered the cycle of reincarnation, so don't cry anymore."
The tortoise and snake generals were tortured into this state.
"His tears are of great use, this is his gratitude, please take it quickly."
"Strange, another old friend, is it that Huangmei has brought all of Old Pig's old friends here?"
"Do not look at what is not proper to look at, and do not listen to what is not proper to listen to."
"You little brat, you're ruining my mood!"
"Old man, it's been a long time since we last saw each other. You've grown in temperament!"
"These gods shouldn't be hanging around in heaven, what are they doing in Little West Heaven?"
"As a small fairy, I was banished to the mortal realm and lost most of my powers."
"I have no other desires, I just want to live a good life."
"I'll just die, I can't be a god, and I'm being bullied by you, this monkey."
"Old man, I can't move at all."
I need to take a pill made from the soul of a dog named Xi Gou to revive myself.
"How are you still here, old man? I don't have much time left."
"It hurts, it hurts!"
"Brother Dog of the Ninth Hour, good medicine."
"According to his temperament, he must be fanning in front of a furnace again."
It's no surprise that it was the old man who was bullying you.
"Don't blame the brave, we are old acquaintances, and I know his temper very well."
"This old dragon still has his strength, but he's just after my elixir. Just give it to him."
"The young can be taught, the young can be taught."
"With this elixir, one would have the power to open that treasure land."
This idyllic landscape is a world of its own that we have created together.
"Now that the monkey has returned to its rightful place, the Six Immortals and the Six Heavenly Generals should also reunite."
"Ah, ah, monster, get away! Get away, get away!"
"Don't come over, don't come over"
Attack! Kill all these monsters!
"You, you won't eat me, will you?"
"I am a young man, and I came to this mountain to seek treasure, but I did not expect to meet a monster."
"Thanks to the hero's rescue, once the treasure is obtained, I will share it with the hero."
"They say this place is the Western Paradise of Buddhism, but why are there so many demons and monsters here?"
"If you enter a dangerous situation again, can you visit the hero for help again?"
"Strange and unusual, round and shiny, green skin,"
"You're so stupid, how can you be so dumb?"
Fire!
"The hero's strategy is truly ingenious, as it almost froze me to death in this snow-covered mountain range."
It's much warmer now.
"I've heard that there's a melon field in this mountain, which was planted by the Buddha hundreds of years ago."
"Take a bite, and you'll live longer."
"It's just that it's freezing cold, and I don't have the power of a hero to protect myself."
It is indeed difficult to find.
"Previously, someone saw a chubby-headed baby holding a watermelon jump off a cliff."
"The man ran to the edge of the cliff to look, but there was no sign of anyone, and he guessed that the child must have died."
"I could hear the laughter of the child coming from the cliff below, one after another..."
"The man ran away in fear, his pants down and his urine streaming."
I suspect there must be a thousand and one connections between them.
Could it be that the melon field is down there on the cliff?
Heroes do not need to stay here to guard.
"I will sit for a moment, wait for my body to warm up, and then leave on my own."
"Trying you three times, you are still a foolishly kind person who doesn't know the difference between good and bad."
Even the big brother can make mistakes sometimes.
A small trick can easily deceive.
"You can't become a divine being, so you might as well go to paradise early."
Just a brute force.
"The task given by the big brother has been completed, see you later!"
"Sure enough, there is a wisdom root."
"Relax, there's no nonsense here, just fighting and killing."
"Good melon, ripe"
Try it?
"Don't look down on this melon. Back then, Sun Wukong used it to trick my little servant."
"Come here, come closer."
"Since we've found this place, there's something neither of them can do, and I can teach it to you."
/
"The prohibition of words, not killing enemies, only restraining oneself"
"What is the妙用 of this, you will understand it yourself."
There is an old friend of Sun Wukong who came to see me and said he wanted to be quiet.
"I sent him to the Pagoda of Floating Towers, have you ever met him?"
It's said that you are the chosen one.
"But if our fate is left to the heavens, what's the point?"
"Grandpa, I'm tired. Let's rest in the pavilion."
"Hey! You little demon, where did you come from again?"
"Hush, I'm carefully observing the big Buddha across the way."
"Look at his navel, it's this big."
"Bigger than me, bigger than you, by several circles."
Buddha? Where did the Buddha come from?
You can't see the Buddha because there is no Buddha in your heart.
"There is no Buddha to worship, so naturally the eyes are blind."
"I, the pure land messenger, have never seen a great Buddha or a small Buddha!"
"You're the one with bad eyesight, not knowing to bow to the living Buddha in front of you."
"If your heart is sincere, the connection will come, and when the connection comes, the Buddha will appear."
The two devotees may want to look around some more and pay their respects.
What's the point of looking for it?
"Enter every temple you see, worship every Buddha you see, regardless of whether it is real or fake, that's my master."
"I, the old pig, have always hated this superficiality."
"If your heart is not sincere, the mountain will not open."
"If your heart is sincere, the road will come to you."
Monks should burn incense at temples and worship Buddha when they meet him.
"You, a mere mortal, how could you possibly understand the mysteries of the heavens?"
"Don't worry, don't worry, look around again."
"To perform Buddhist rituals, one must have a respectful attitude towards Buddhism."
The old pig understood.
"The little monk told us to look around, which means we have to worship four times!"
"Crazy monk, you're too unreasonable!"
"Young man, just do it for show."
"That little monk was playing tricks, but who knows if it was real or not?"
When passing through the Little West Heaven
"It was because the old master thought that he should bow to the Buddha when he arrived at Lingshan, and was caught by Huangmei."
The old pig won't fall for it.
What's the commotion!
"It must be that little monk playing tricks again, what's the point of bowing, go back and see!"
"Little fat monk, you've worshiped everything you can, what about the road?"
"Road? The road has always been there, hasn't it?"
"You fat-headed bald child, dare you scare me, old pig!"
"There are only smooth mountains everywhere, where is the road!"
"He, has a慧根"
"You, your heart is not sincere."
"Damn you, grandmother!"
Are you not that old thief who has transformed into this form to play tricks on people?
Eat my mace!
"I don't care if I don't bow, you're acting so desperate."
"My cultivation is not even as good as the junior disciples around me, is it shameful?"
Damn that old pig!
"This road is blocked, grandpa will dig a path out of it!"
"You go ahead, we'll meet at the summit."
"One monkey dies, another monkey comes."
"When I peel off your face, I'll go and play as a Tianming person too."
The show is about to begin!
"Sir, please wait a moment while I tell you my story."
"I am a fox demon who has been practicing in the mountains, with the intention of becoming human."
"Who would have thought that day, when I went out to find food, I fell into a trap set by hunters?"
"In a dream, I saw a scholar come to save me and take me home to recover."
"I can't move, but I'm full of gratitude."
"Originally, I wanted to wait until my body was healthy before helping him seek fame and fortune, in order to repay his life-saving kindness."
"I never expected that the scholar would have a dream in the south and kill me after waking up, leaving my ghost to haunt the world."
"I searched high and low, only to find out that he had entered the Buddhist monastery, and he was in the Little Leiyin Temple."
"Please, my lord, take my hair and transform into a human to go and see him once, to relieve my inner turmoil."
I know he's hiding in the side hall of the temple. Please take me to see him.
"With all the various delusions and speculations of self-will, which one is the true self, who can know?"
"This is a place for Buddhist meditation and fasting. The monk has a full body of killing aura, please sit down and chant with the old monk."
"We are both sinners, and life is long. Many things must be done."
"The old monk has realized the red dust, and in his remaining life, he only seeks to remain in this temple, reciting scriptures and sitting in meditation, to redeem his old sins."
"Brother, reciting a thousand sutras is easy, but practicing what you know is difficult."
"I wish I had known better,"" said the old monk, ""I wish I had known better."
"A single thought can give rise to all phenomena, and a single thought can extinguish all phenomena."
What is right? What is wrong?
"Killing is a sin, but if it is for the greater good, is it not necessary to kill?"
"The eye is affected by color, the ear distinguishes sound, the nose smells various fragrances, and the tongue tastes various flavors."
"All the sense organs, craving for all kinds of contact, the mind root distinguishing, all kinds of things"
"The six emotions and sensory organs each have their own specific causes, and the various sensory experiences do not cause each other."
"You, you, are you a person or a ghost?"
"For so many years, I have been reciting sutras for you every day, but you still want to take my life?"
You wouldn't know how much pain I felt when I took action...
"Since your resentment has not yet subsided, with the compassion of the Buddha, I will reincarnate you once more!"
"Even if one enters the empty door, they cannot be liberated..."
"Demon is demon... incurable..."""
There are always reasons for things and people are responsible for their actions.
People always say that humans and demons have different destinies.
"When I saw him again, I realized"
Those who fear demons are even more terrifying than demons themselves.
"Very good, very good."
It remembers your taste.
"When that monkey was alive, he only knew how to beg and cry."
"Even after death, they bring misfortune to their descendants, causing you all to come forward."
My backpack is almost full.
"Kang Jinlong, your Dharma nature has been enlightened."
Come out and help me test his quality.
"Look at this monkey, is it worthy enough to be my disciple?"
"Once you enter this cycle, you won't be able to easily reincarnate again."
"Long ago, I was still a fellow disciple with Jin Chanzi."
He is a serious person.
"I can't stand the sight of the Ling Shan always shrouded in auspicious light and clouds, but the mountain below is suffering from the miseries of natural disasters."
"He said, ""All beings have a root of wisdom."
"Why are only you and I the ones who are elevated, while others are only fit to bow and burn incense?"
"I said, because they are not as good as you and me."
"Later, he committed a great sin and was reincarnated again."
I have taken in a few more disciples.
What was the outcome?
"The disciple died, fled, and even he himself hid away."
"In my opinion, those who go to seek the scriptures are all trash."
"Believe in what dog shit Buddha, I'd rather do it myself."
"Seeing the future, why not pay homage?"
Stubborn as a rock!
This place is prepared for those who are lost.
Go in and ponder on it for a while!
"You're a thickhead, even you've been caught by that old thief?"
"This bag is much more sinister than before, and it has nurtured such a powerful and dangerous monster."
"Guessing that the old thief borrowed the senior brother's cultivation, he patched up this torn bag again."
"Let's go together, let's kill our way out first!"
Do you remember when the Buddha said at the Ghost Festival?
The suffering of all beings is often due to not observing the precepts and indulging in desires.
"To be honest, I don't think so."
"Do not kill, hatred never ends"
"Don't steal, and the difference between strong and weak is the same as mine."
"Do not indulge in lust, and all beings will be free from suffering."
"Do not speak falsely, dreams, illusions, bubbles, and emptiness."
"I don't crave for wine, but I'm worried about the ups and downs of life."
"Do not indulge in pleasure, for beauty is fleeting."
"Don't be greedy for sleep, and you won't be able to escape from it."
"Do not indulge in lust, and all actions will lack vitality."
"All things are empty, but the cause and effect are not empty."
"Kill them all, kill them all!"
"Yes, that's right, that's you."
"Little nephew, hold on! Don't lose your mind!"
"Come on, let me make you kill even more smoothly!"
"Everything is impermanent, and all appearances are obstacles."
"Pick up the butcher's knife, and even a demon can become a Buddha!"
Use their body to apply their own method.
"Cause and effect, retribution is inevitable."
"Buddha"" means ""awakening"" in Chinese."
"You have the Buddha nature, and you can surely become a Buddha."
"I have 3,000 disciples and countless followers."
"All are prepared for you, for you to slaughter."
Who among the six realms of existence does not harbor a killing intent?
"Besides, heaven also kills people, and earth also kills people!"
"You have committed many evil deeds, and have gone through one hell after another."
Let me help you with the final rebirth.
I... I've seen through your fate long ago.
"As long as you continue to fight for others, sooner or later, you will die in the hands of others."
"I am Huangmei, only for myself."
I didn't lose...
I won't lose...
"As long as, as long as I use that monkey's treasure one more time..."
This demon beast took my treasure down to the lower realm earlier.
"With the help of the Great Sage, I transformed my afterlife bag into a seductive and evil treasure."
"He also transformed into my appearance, using my name to deceive many old enemies, and was determined to seek revenge."
"Big belly, I should have guessed it was you!"
"Pardon me, pardon me."
I'll believe you once I've been tricked.
"Twice I've turned you, even pigs wouldn't believe it!"
"I don't believe it either, but I wonder how bold this demon is."
"I was going to personally take him in, but the two benefactors arrived first."
"Wukong, you are indeed blessed with great fortune and great life, but he, so young, is so extraordinary."
"This time, perhaps... I didn't misjudge him."
Don't say such unhelpful things.
Your yellow-haired brat's accidental drowning is a minor matter.
"If the big brother's things are lost, it will be difficult to find them again."
"You're that nine-pronged iron pitchfork, and I'll borrow it for a while."
"Brother, you've been down here for quite some time."
Speak plainly.
"This time, I won again, Golden Cicada."
"Disturbing the mind, reversing cause and effect"
"Brother, your obsession with winning and losing is so ridiculous and pitiful."
"If we cannot win, what is the point of proving the cause and effect of human nature?"
No mercy for the dead.
"This is a temple, don't worry, let's go in and take a look."
"It's freezing cold, even the old pig's nose is about to freeze!"
"Let's get to the point, I'm not interested."
"Since you're here, I'll help you change that old rusty armor."
"The sword is ready, my hand is itching, and I'm worried there's no one to try it out."
"To begin with, I made this sword out of copper and iron."
We are not responsible for any damage caused by rubbing or bumping.
"A piece of scrap iron, not worthy of my martial arts!"
Here you go!
I'll play one more round.
"Wearing tattered clothes, no wonder you came here."
"This is the real deal, no need to send it!"
"Young one, do you know the origin of the Yellow Eyebrow?"
"He was originally a servant boy who rang the bell in front of the Eastern Coming Buddha, Maitreya."
"Stole the Maitreya Buddha's treasure, became a demon on the lower realm"
"When we were on our way to the West, we passed through Little West Heaven, and Huangmei pretended to be Little Leiyin."
"Master, you don't know what's good or bad, you came in and knelt down, you've been tricked."
That Yellow Eyebrow Demon wanted to kill us disciples and go on a pilgrimage himself.
"After all these years, he hasn't changed that aspect of himself."
The big brother was once trapped in the golden bell like the old pig.
It was the Golden Dragon who inserted his horn into him to save him out.
"Now he has become the subordinate of the Yellow Eyebrow Demon, how strange!"
Could it be that that demon has obtained another treasure that can bewitch people's minds?
"When it comes to treasures, the most powerful treasure in Huangmei Old Monster's hands is the Afterlife Bag!"
"The 28 star constellations in the sky, the two generals of the turtle and snake under the Northern True Dragon Emperor"
There are also the young Prince Zhang sent by the National Teacher Wang Pusa and the Four Great General Gods.
"That torn bag opens its mouth, and not one escapes."
"The big brother didn't know what to do, he was very sad, and his master Moli came."
"It's a coincidence, isn't it? Just when I was at my wit's end, this fat monk appeared."
"When the master arrives, Huangmei's威风 is no longer up."
"But if I had to say, he didn't really give up, and he's always been resentful of the big brother who ruined his future."
"Brother, this is a great job that you've given us, it's a real stroke of luck!"
Big deal!
This road is so bumpy that I've worn out my shoulders and bones!
"Hurry up and go, don't miss my drinking."
I heard that the witch has some strange habits.
"Eight seasons and four times of the year require nourishment, and each time of nourishment requires marriage."
"Once, the lady came here to congratulate, and picked a precious mirror as a gift."
"Known as ""Mirror of Bones"
Wait a moment.
Bone Mirror...
"I remember the lady often mentioned it, and spoke of it with regret."
Wait until I finish speaking.
"The witch took the mirror and looked at it, and then she lost her mind and threw the mirror away."
"The lady therefore took it out on her, and stopped moving around herself."
Talk nonstop
I haven't been able to sleep well on this journey.
Who! Who's inside?
Dare you touch the gift from the Witch Mountain?!
"Nowadays, no matter where you hide, there's no peace."
Where did the female Buddha come from? Please come down and speak.
Are you leaving already? What are you shy about...
"It seems like there's a populated area ahead, let's take a look?"
"This place is deserted, only some weak demons are trying to cheat us in various ways."
"I'm sorry, but I can't help"
Little monkey! I haven't finished yet!
This is a trap.
Don't be in a hurry.
Let Uncle help you too.
"Please come in, we are having a banquet inside. Please come in and have a few cups of light wine."
"Hey, two esteemed guests, why are you here so late?"
"Your wife, she didn't come again, did she?"
"Lady, due to her status, she is not able to appear in the lower realm."
"But she has always been thinking of you all, and has sent this small gift to express her gratitude."
"The lady said, ""I hope the fairy will recover soon and go to heaven to visit soon."
It's a pity that the lady won't be here.
"We've got a great show prepared, and we've been waiting for this long time."
And now...
"The gift was stolen, and the person was killed."
Let's not...
I'll take you two as a substitute for the water jar!
"We are just servants doing the work, grandmother, what kind of joke are you talking about?"
Pig……Eight……Squire……
I know you're ugly and afraid to see people.
"But you don't have to pretend to be another pig face to please my mother, right?"
No sense of direction
"I, the old pig, am devoted to Buddhism, and I don't know who your mother is, so you'll have to wait."
How cold-hearted!
"You killed and burned on this ridge, destroying her reputation."
Now they don't remember anymore?
What is your reputation?
/
/
"I see, you're the junior of the spider demon."
"It's over, it's over."
"Call me 'good uncle', old pig, and I'll give you a few face-saving measures. Go to that broken hole and meet your old friends."
It doesn't matter if you want to go or not.
It's not up to you!
Damn it!
"You, these insects, wearing human skin and clothes, can only do such underhanded things!"
"Yes, yes, yes."
How can you compare to the open and honest nature of the Great General Tianpeng?
"The body of that one, I reckon it's still warm."
You've found another new monkey to worship as your elder brother again?
"Shut up, you bastard!"
Teach your mother to come out and beg for mercy early.
"Uncle, I pity you for your youth and ignorance, and I leave you a miserable life."
"To be honest with you, the object is in the Pan Si Cave."
"If you're afraid, just run away quickly."
Your son is afraid!
"Today, I will fill this hole once and for all."
Where do you think you're going to hide now that you're all together?
I've heard that there's a treasure of great value inside.
"You look so agile, why don't you go in and look around?"
"A bunch of old geezers, the talismans are pretty powerful..."
Can you jump up and down so quickly?
"If you don't want to get into trouble, you'd better not interfere with what's happening here."
It's important to catch up with that pig as soon as possible.
The road is already paved for you.
"Saving others is easy, but saving oneself is difficult."
Let's see who's got the better skills from here on out.
Stinky monkey
You said...
The world beyond this mountain ridge
What kind of thing is it?
Great joy! Great joy!
Shut up!
"What a stupid thing, hurry up and leave!"
"Hurry up, they're here!"
"It's not like you're getting married, why are you in such a hurry?"
"I'll show you who's boss today, you little hoof!"
"Please forgive me, good sister."
Here it comes!
The bridegroom has arrived!
"I'm sorry I'm late, sisters have been waiting for a long time."
I wonder what kind of handsome young man my mother has been thinking about day and night.
How can you be so stupid and ugly?
The face is a bit dirty...
It's fine as long as your mother likes it.
"Ugly is ugly, but I've heard that he used to have some skills."
"In order to catch him, the mother used all her family heirlooms."
But it took a lot of effort from the old lady.
The second sister is really diligent.
Caught something good
Why don't we let the sisters try it first?
"Sister, you have a big temper."
The person that the mother has been thinking about marrying.
Missing a finger
We're all in for a rough time.
What good is it to marry him?
We're not going to spend our whole lives here.
You're not even at peace.
Want to see
Let's go to the front to see.
"I say, little sisters."
This is just the beginning of the ceremony.
Are you in a hurry to have the wedding ceremony?
It's just the essence of my mother's cultivation.
We don't need to worry about that.
Sister
I'll leave it to you.
You've had a long and tiring journey.
Sister...
Mother is old and confused.
The sisters don't know what's going on.
Can't you see it too?
You should feel sorry for your mother.
It's also our duty as children to do our part.
I understand her pain too.
Her illness has been a problem for decades and she can't get better.
It was all thanks to this stupid thing.
"If you don't hate, then it's fine, but you're still trampling on yourself."
I...
I can't go on with the performance.
"Some things, don't look at right or wrong beauty and ugliness."
It doesn't matter whether you win or lose.
It's all fate woven by chance and fate.
Sister...
Neither of us was born at that time.
I have never seen my mother use it before.
She is also unable to understand
What's going on with Master Brother over there?
Take it one step at a time.
Borrowed blessings
Being able to enjoy one more day is also good.
"You, follow me."
The room ahead is Mother's room.
Here are a few things I want to tell you.
Mother is usually good.
Only when eating do I love to enjoy it alone.
Don't go near her.
And
Don't look at her face too closely.
Especially the eyes
"Sister, we can't delay any longer."
I'll be counting on you to remember this carefully.
"Hurry up, don't miss the time."
Brother...
You made me wait so long.
Heaven is indeed not a place for humans to live.
It's good to be back.
Girls
Let's have a feast!
What is it?
"It's just a night of passion, and it's not worth the life of the old pig to pay for it."
"You're following me closely, do you think I can't get anything done without me old pig?"
"A boil, don't drag your grandfather down."
"Damn it, you little brat, you've seen it all, and you want to laugh at old piggy?"
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
"Don't bother me, get out!"
"Pony Master, didn't you die?"
It's all your fault!
"The old pig wants to live a happy life here, and he doesn't want to take me away again."
As a seasoned game
Are you not forgetting that it was me who was the one who didn't want to kill you back then when the monkey left me to do the job of silencing you?
I haven't forgotten.
But what I can
"After you left, how did I survive by relying on the flesh and bones of my sisters?"
"This grudge can't be entirely blamed on us, we should blame it on your senior brother."
It's because he values the meat of Tang Monk more than your sisters' lives.
Brother... was a moment of confusion.
"Afterward, he was filled with remorse and made many compensations."
Even... I was willing to use that thing to prolong my life.
Otherwise... how could I have survived until today to see you?
"Good sister, are you serious?"
"What is that thing, now in your hands?"
Brother
By this point
What's on your mind?
It's still that monkey.
What monkey?
"Hahahaha, you're kidding me, right?"
"Stinky monkey, you don't have my mark."
Say more of what I like to hear.
When I'm in a good mood.
"Perhaps out of mercy, he will tell you where that thing is."
"You, this evil woman, dare to go to the spring and look at yourself."
"At this age, you still talk about love and affection."
Really funny!
I am trapped in this cave.
"Day and night, waiting for you."
I always think of you.
I want to eat you right after we have sex.
Cure my root disease
Eat if you want to eat.
"This is a bit of a strange way to go about it, with the wedding ceremony and the toast."
What's wrong with you?
Pfft!
I can't eat anymore...
It's not just for you.
And it's for her.
"This little girl is dark and ugly, who knows whose offspring!"
Your fate today has nothing to do with me.
I only regret that I was too kind-hearted and soft-handed at the time!
How long have you been here? I was almost dead!
"Quickly, let this witch down and let me go!"
Hurry up and call your sisters over.
I have lived this life.
I hate monkeys the most.
All of you are ruining my good things.
I wonder
Where are these monkeys not better than?
Since you like monkeys so much
I will cut out his heart.
Dig out his liver
Let's try it together!
"Don't worry about me, hurry up and catch up, it's important to get back my brother's belongings!"
"Hurry and run for your life, I have a plan!"
Brother Senior...
"Brother, save me!"
"If you taught me how to set up a trap and helped me with your法宝, how did I lose?"
"If I really saw him, I..."
I can't bring myself to do it.
"Later, the Tianming people arrived, and I couldn't fight them off."
The cave has been turned upside down by that monkey.
"A mere monkey, how rude!"
Your old injury has not healed yet.
He inflicted new injuries on me again.
"Don't worry, I'll take care of it for you!"
Sister-in-law
My thing...
But is it still on you?
Still...
Sister...
"You may not be good at everything, but you can bring the Heavenly Destiny and the People here."
It's also a good deed.
But I borrowed your things
You have to return it first!
"You little ones, how can you understand my intentions?"
As long as you swallow up the remaining faculties of the people of destiny.
I can no longer be controlled by Kunlun.
"Sister, your revenge, I will naturally take care of it."
"You have suffered for a lifetime, go in peace."
"Grandmaster, come down to save me..."
Mother!
You're still the same as you were back then...
Stupid...
Mother! Mother!
Come and take my life?
Good!
"I can't live like this anymore, I can't get out!"
"Don't stand there, hurry up and finish me off."
"This cave is impossible to escape from. Please, kill me."
"Finally, I was able to escape from..."
"One hole opens, a hundred holes open, this time it's time for me to ascend."
"After many days of cultivation, the eight-handed technique was perfected."
"You, finally came."
Destiny of Man
"Master, I have an order from you, let me try my hand first."
"You, this mad thief, don't be too pleased."
"When I have mastered the divine mechanism, I will come back to settle the account with you!"
"I sacrificed myself to enter the egg, for what purpose?"
"You don't thank me, but you cut off my hand."
I'll have to chop you down and make you pay for it!
I understand... entering the egg and ascending?
"Useless limbs, gone!"
"It was my fault for falling for the old monk's trick, so the previous bet doesn't count."
Want to know how to defeat that demon king? Come and fight me head-on!
That needle...
Go to Purple Cloud Mountain to find...
"My lord, my lord, it's all my fault. I have no power to avenge you."
"I can only cry and beg here, hoping that a kind-hearted person passing by the mountain will help me find your body."
"Little master, I apologize for my behavior."
I am a widow who has come here to mourn my deceased husband. Please do not blame me.
My husband and I used to live in a village on the mountain top.
"One day, a group of insect demons suddenly appeared and wanted to forcibly occupy this place."
"In the village, people either died or fled, leaving me alone..."
I originally wanted to go back to that village to look for some of my husband's belongings.
"However, among that group of insect demons, there was a leader named Poisonous Enemy King."
"His poison is very powerful, and now I have no chance of winning..."
Do you also need to go to the back mountain?
"All the creatures in the forest are poisonous demons,"
"Remember to prepare more antidote herbs, don't be too strong..."
"Today's wine, today's drunkenness, don't worry about what's right or wrong in front of the door..."
"Damn it, damn it!"
"Let those who oppress my people's fate not have the opportunity to kill them, but instead let me protect them here."
"Hurry up, don't get in my way while I'm drinking alone."
"Look at your sickly appearance, grandpa will throw two hooks, and you will die, why not keep your life?"
"Don't wander around here, if you break my wine jar, you'll see what I'm capable of."
Daring!
"You, this hairy monster, I intended to let you go, but you insist on making things difficult for me and seeking your own death!"
This secluded place hasn't seen a living person for a long time.
"Little monk, you have a sharp mouth and a small nose, and you are thin and pale-faced."
"He looks like a sickly ghost, could it be that he's also been infected by the insect poison?"
This valley contains a strange insect called the Lyre Ant.
He has three heads and six arms.
"However, once the larvae hatch, they will devour the five internal organs and six viscera, leaving only an immortal body."
"My fellow brothers and younger brothers are all not afraid of evil, greedy for credit and rash, and eat when they see it."
Nowadays... it's probably too late to save them.
"Little monk, if you have the heart, please help me settle them."
"As a fellow disciple, I can't bring myself to do it."
"Their bodies, or they still have intact new eggs inside."
"Bring it to me on your way, and I'll find a way to break it."
Good! Good! Good! It's exactly what we need!
"This kind of monster, with its strange appearance and shape, I need to bring it back to the temple to study it carefully."
"Little monk, we've met before, it's rare."
"Let's do it one more time for me, leave the monkey head here, so I can report to my master."
"This kind of ability... just right, just right."
It's perfect for you to be the first blood sacrifice for my transformation and ascension.
These ordinary mortals are overestimating themselves.
This is the result of their own actions.
"You're different. This is a poisonous creature in the world, and it's not easy to kill you."
"Keep this thing well and use it wisely, and you will find its wonders endless."
"Go and save him, he's trapped there and must be suffering greatly."
I can't bring myself to do it...
"It's been years since we last saw each other, and you've been reduced to this state by them."
I come from the Liushan Mountains and am here to investigate the matter in the valley.
"I didn't mean to deceive you, there are indeed some difficulties."
"I met his mother once, and I couldn't bring myself to do it, which is why I brought you here."
"I thought this thing had already fallen into the hands of that many-eyed monster, but you found it."
Perhaps this is just a chance.
"Since that's the case, I'll help you restore the power of this object as a token of my gratitude."
It's just a few threads hanging down from the sky.
He's a good
Why do people all want to climb up?
"Stop, and let him go."
"You're a stubborn monkey, it's the nth time you've been born, and you're still so unemotional."
"I'm reckless and cause trouble, and I've messed up the business in heaven."
Accompanying a self-important little girl
"Don't worry, I will definitely turn her into a golden pill and keep it for you."
"If you cause trouble again in your next life, remember to come to heaven to take it."
"The old pig once served as the governor of the天河, overseeing an army of 80,000 water soldiers."
These ghostly soldiers and demons dare to block our path?
"If it weren't for my miraculous transformation, you would have been dead today."
Give your uncle a loud bow?
"Hmph, I've learned my lesson once, I won't make the same mistake twice!"
This kind of cheat and fake person is not to be feared.
"I'll go ahead and check it out first, you little guy, hurry up and follow me."
"It's you, this monkey head..."
I was just fighting with those ghost soldiers when I suddenly lost consciousness...
"I am the vanguard of the Great Sage's army, and I'm glad I didn't harm your life!"
"Forgive you, forgive you!"
I've heard about your matter.
"The thing you're looking for, the big king must know."
"Now there are demons in the mountains, and I don't know where these demons came from."
"The pass on the mountain was also blocked by several hearse cars, burning the old man with evil fire..."
"I think you're pretty good at this, find a way to take them all apart, how about that?"
"The coffin car is also known as the five-wheeled car, which is an alien object refined by the king's child, and it is very powerful."
That carriage is not just stopping us from going up the mountain.
I think there's something fishy about it!
"Right now, I still have to guard the mountain gate. This Fire Mountain is in chaos, and I can't be absent."
I'll just stand here...
Who dares to come!
Bring me a few more yin soldiers so I can kill them and feel satisfied!
Listen!
"Hong Huaier sent out five carriages, which were used as a distraction."
Thank goodness I'm smart!
Pfft! Little brat!
"Hurry up and go up the mountain, I want to see what's in his bottle."
It was a爽 experience to kill!
"Look, I'll just swing my big axe..."
That disobedient son heard some nonsense from somewhere and caused such a commotion on Mount Flaming Fire.
Why does the big king let him be manipulated?
"With his skills, ten Red Children wouldn't stand a chance!"
"The old king looked far away, neither seeing a mount nor a mixed iron rod..."
What is the reason behind this... What else is there in the Fire Mountain...
I don't understand! I don't understand!
We need to find the璧水金晴兽 first.
"The Waterfall Golden-Eyed Beast is the elder king's beloved mount, like a brother, how could it have disappeared?"
Niu Mang is righteous and honorable without equal.
Serving him is my pleasure.
But I let down my big brother.
He failed to complete the task I gave him.
"In order to that demon, the big king must have done something stupid."
"This secret, I'm afraid, is behind that door."
That little ghost car is no problem at all.
I did it on purpose!
"You're a top-notch monkey head, but..."
Never lose sight of the main goal...
Pursuing the end...
Who can save me!
"Save him, little master! Save him! Save him!"
"Monkey brother, it's you!"
"Save me! Monkey brother, save me!"
"There was a change in the mountains, and only I escaped."
I don't want to be captured by demons on the way down the mountain again.
I've been hanging here for three days and three nights...
"I don't know what kind of karmic relationship I have accumulated in previous lives, but I have met a good brother in this life."
"If you are willing to spare your great compassion, save my family and me."
"Even if I sell my body and life, I must repay the great kindness."
The king is right.
This little girl's cries are indeed alluring.
What sound is that?
It's them...
My captors are back!
"Brother, hurry and save me!"
"Hehehe, good bait for the hook"
What should we do now?
"Haha, burn them all, burn them to a crisp!"
"My dear nephew, you have a taste for the good life."
More tender than the old pig
Demon!
"What is your name, and who are you?"
If there is a half sentence of fabrication
Uncle's mallet doesn't have eyes!
"Thank you so much for saving me, it was a close call."
"I am the daughter of the Great Sage, my name is Pingping..."
Hu Chai!
Where did the Ox Demon King come from a daughter?
"You're trying to trick me, old pig! I'll give you a beating!"
I... remember you.
"My mother, the Jade-Faced Princess..."
It's you who killed me!
"After my mother's death, I have been living with my father."
Iron Fan Princess is kind-hearted and considers me as her adopted daughter.
Later...
"My brother returned from the South Sea after completing his studies, and we reunited as a family."
"Finally, I can live in peace."
Brother has always been filial.
You've been very kind to me as well.
"However, he suddenly changed his personality not long ago for some reason."
He secretly summoned the old troops of the Fire Cloud Cave.
"First, he imprisoned his father, then he trapped his mother."
I... I really have no other choice.
Just came out to call for help.
"As soon as Kokoro stepped out of the mountain pass, she ran into her brother's subordinates..."
That Ox Demon has boundless powers.
I fought with my senior brother and we couldn't defeat him.
The Iron Fan Spirit has a divine treasure to protect her
How did you end up in a cage in your mouth?
Who could have imagined that their own son would turn against them?
"As a parent, who would really be cruel enough to hurt their own child?"
"You fool, this little fox is playing with you!"
Take a look at this place...
"If it weren't for my brother's Three-Flame True Fire, how could I have ended up in such a miserable state!"
Oh no!
"Father's life is in danger, please help me and my family get through this disaster..."
The Fire Mountain is extremely dangerous.
This little mosquito you should keep.
"At that time, it will be useful."
This voice is very familiar.
"I'll go and see for myself, old pig."
It's too late.
"Monkey brother, I'll lead the way in front."
Come on!
What did the pig elder tell you in private just now?
"I won't hold it against him for the past blood debt, but he seems to have such a strong hostility..."
"This mountain and the outside, everywhere are my brother's subordinates."
"Monkey brother, please follow me closely."
"Once upon a time, my brother and I used to play in this mountain."
The six generals will still make us happy and live a good life.
"There's a hole here that we can pass through. I'll go first, and you can go ahead."
Two feet are not as good as four feet.
It's my father's voice... He's right there!
"My brother's Three-Flame True Fire is really powerful, the path up the mountain has already been sealed off..."
"To put out this fire, we need to use Mother's peach blossom fan... but Mother..."
"Jump down from here, there is a secret passage leading to the mother's palace."
She should still be inside.
"Mother has always spoiled her elder brother, how could she easily give up the fan..."
I remember!
"Not far from here, there is another high-ranking person living, and it is said that he was also a friend of my mother in the past."
"If we could persuade him to come out of retirement and join us in convincing our mother, we could take advantage of the opportunity to borrow the peach fan and increase our chances by a few more points!"
"I'll be back soon, Monkey Brother, take care of yourself!"
"Monkeys, sticks, dead, alive, king, all must be!"
"Stop! The king has ordered, anyone who dares to enter the queen's forbidden palace will be killed!"
This little mosquito you should keep.
"At that time, it will be useful."
"Brother long, brother short, why come here to bother your brother?"
"Child, I want to borrow Mother's fan to save my father."
"Save, the fire mountain disaster, a fan, may not be able to save"
"Mother! Mother, please help me!"
"If we keep dragging this out, my brother's ferocity will erupt, and our father will surely die!"
Are you really concerned about that lewd old ox?
"Don't think that as a mother, I don't know your little intentions."
It's not impossible that they're hoping we'll all die of anger.
"It's good to be with your brother in this mountain, enjoying life."
"Mother, you've been wronged!"
"If it weren't for my concern for my father's safety, I wouldn't have come here to beg the celestial being for help."
"Hmph, a fox spirit is still a fox spirit."
"I see you only want to trick me into giving you the Fan of the Banyan Tree, as a favor to your demon son."
I... I am the flesh and blood of my father's own flesh and blood.
"Thanks to my mother's love, I have been able to survive until now."
"No matter how good my brother is to me, it cannot compare to the grace of my parents."
"The fan thing, my decision is made."
"The sins of the past, now I am not worthy of self-pity."
It's actually you.
Why are you here at this time?
Sister-in-law
This is your family matter.
"As an outsider, I am not in a position to comment."
But Ping'er found me and said that the Tianming people had arrived at the Fire Mountain.
"Destiny, destiny, listen obediently to the will of the heavens"
"Several old men, with names that sound strange and divine."
"His true origin, you and I know."
At that time...
"Your children or your husband, even if they come to this land of the Rokshakas, will be safe."
Nothing can escape the fate of being reduced to ashes.
"A pawn that is not in control of its own destiny,"
Don't talk about the old ox and the child.
My peach blossom fan is not something to be trifled with.
He just learned about his identity when the destiny person arrived right behind him.
"Two things happening at the same time, don't you think it's strange, Senior Sister?"
What about your background?
What is your background?
Who are you talking about?
I have heard that the remaining few relics have fallen into the hands of the people of destiny.
"Sister, things have come to this..."
You still don't understand?
Who made him come back?
"Those things, are they really treasures of cultivation?"
We might all be too clever for our own good.
"In the end, it turned out to be the sacrificial offering that helped him return to life."
I don't care about others' lives or deaths.
I... I have never...
Everyone only cares about you.
Let's not do that.
Let's go together!
How did I treat you on that day?
What will you do with me in the future!
Brother-in-law...
"At this point, only you still care about me."
I... I don't know what to do now.
"Come on, sit up here."
Tell me in detail.
"Mother, you cannot trust him."
"This guy has a sly look on his face, he must have impure intentions!"
Pervert!
"I'm blind and I'm asking you to save me, but you're taking advantage of me."
"You, you dare!"
The elders are speaking.
It's not the place for a concubine to speak out.
When I met your mother
"Your father, he's probably still wearing the ox harness."
I don't know where to plow the land.
"Pervert! Lowlife! Mother, don't believe him!"
"You, go and be quiet for a while!"
It's better now.
"Sister, after descending to the lower realm, little fairy..."
I've never been this close to you before.
"Little brother, in fact, I..."
I also miss the days in the palace.
What is this?
"Pig's feet, what else could it be?"
"If you don't show yourself, you're going to come up and bite me!"
"I'm so angry, I'm so angry!"
What a filthy creature!
Daring to transform into the appearance of my elder sister to deceive me!
"Man, I've got you."
"I miss the days when we worked together to eliminate the fox den, my old pig."
Cunning thing
I have a sincere heart.
You've got me with your disgusting tactics!
What's the point of talking about it?
These demons and ghosts along the way think that the old pig can't tell who's work it is?
"Hey, nephew, you're here too?"
"Perfect timing, let's meet this corrupt and filthy woman who has violated the moral code with my uncle!"
"Damn beast, after all these years, your demon nature still hasn't changed."
"My pouch of rootless water from the Imperial Palace will fall to the ground, and I'll see how you dare to be so bold!"
Once I helped you all on your journey to the west.
Let's go a little further today.
"The Yin and Yang way, always one and opposite."
"The way of heaven and earth, one rises and one descends."
"Today, I'll take you this thief, and feed my Yin-Yang fish."
This family really doesn't know how to behave properly.
So small a fish
Not enough to buy us dinner yet.
The mystery of his origin has been revealed.
Hong Huaier will not give up easily.
This is a chaotic world in your eyes.
It's just a bowl of cold rice on someone else's案板...
This guy got away?
"Old pig, I just took a nap."
"Little Dan童, this is outrageous!"
I used to have a clean background as well.
It's all the big brother's fault...
"It's bad luck, but I fell in love with the wrong person."
"You, go up from here."
Check if there is a path.
I'll go around and look for it again.
"Mother, although I ran away, it's hard to say if the treasure is still in the mountain."
"Monkey brother, come quickly!"
I'm here!
"I found the fan, look!"
"The mother was probably in a difficult situation, so she hid her whereabouts, but left the fan behind."
"But this big iron ball keeps rolling around, never stopping..."
"Luckily, the Monkey Brother arrived in time."
"You go ahead and distract it, while I use the fan to put out the fire."
Little fox
Is this really... the Peach Blossom Fan?
"Don't worry, mother taught me how to use incantations."
One strike and you'll know the truth.
"The old ox was making a very weak sound, and it seemed like it only had half a breath left."
"Old pig, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and use all my strength to block that iron ball, while you use your fan to take advantage of the situation."
"Zhu Bajie has thick skin and tough flesh, he can't die easily."
"Monkey brother, let's go save our father first!"
"Bitch, look quickly, there's a hairy-faced one, even uglier than me!"
"You're a thief, I think you're confused."
"The lady instructed us to guard this place, and you just kill whoever comes in, regardless of whether they are ugly or not!"
Alright!
"You little demon, dare you be so bold in front of the old ox!"
I'm not staying anymore.
"Don't cry, don't cry."
"The master only thought to let this child be born safely, but he didn't know how much trouble I had to go through."
/
"Besides, you have already drunk the water from the River of Mother and Child in front of him."
"Shut up, don't mention this again."
"My lord, I know I must drink..."
"However, after that, he didn't show his face again and found a new excuse for not returning home."
"Sister, that old ox mustn't see these."
"He can make room for you in this cave, and send the Golden Monkey to guard it, which is already giving enough face to the master."
You must keep your mouth shut at all times.
"If anyone else finds out about this kid's background, our family will be in big trouble."
"Sister, don't worry, the master has sent me here to assist in secret."
You should take good care of that old ox and raise him to adulthood.
"When this child grows up, he will be the best witness to the blood debt of the Ling Shan."
"Father, father, I have brought the will of heaven upon you."
"While the brother is not around, the father can return that thing to him."
"Once this object is returned to its rightful owner, brother will naturally give up."
The calamity of the Fire Mountain has been resolved.
"Good for you, monkey..."
How dare you be so reckless...
They won't die cleanly.
Alas...
It's not the right time...
Is my father confused?
My daughter has brought the people of destiny to save you.
Is it a bit hazy...
But my eyes aren't blurry...
You... you're not my daughter.
"Where did you get this idea from, father?"
"Pingping endured countless hardships, found someone, and put out the fire."
Is it just to return to my father?
I wish I had just blinded my eyes...
To avoid seeing you act strange...
"Don't worry, "
old beast.
It won't take long to satisfy your desires.
It's a waste of my efforts to show off such skills.
"It's boring, really boring."
Let's just kill them all quickly!
"I dressed up as that little demoness, and I asked myself if I was indistinguishable from her."
How did you figure it out?
She... doesn't seem like you...
"Show respect on the surface, but have no fear in your heart."
"Ah, I see."
I'm sure I'll have to catch that little bitch again and play with her properly.
/
"For now, let's burn you two good brothers and bury them together."
Leisurely and elegant
There's plenty of time!
You son of a bitch...
Wherever I go...
Where would there be a broken home and a destroyed family?
"The young one may have temporarily fallen, but his spirit has not dispersed."
I'm afraid he won't be able to stand up for half an hour.
"This thing, I've been keeping it sealed in my stomach pouch since I got it."
Nobody knows
I'm old...
I'm afraid of everything...
Afraid of fighting
Afraid of death
Afraid of his wife
Afraid of the son
So...
I dare not eat.
"He came to ask for it, and I dare not give it to him..."
"Dog's屁命, all are miserable."
Don't believe these shortcuts.
Whether this can be corrected again depends entirely on the previous karma and fate.
Thanks to this breath-holding talisman
"Although the old man of the land is not as good as others in terms of skills, he can die in peace."
I said how did I fan without a single drop of rain falling?
"It turns out that it has always been you, this clumsy fellow, playing tricks on me."
"Brother Ox, I'm sorry I'm a bit late, Big Pig."
"Stinky brat, today I'll take the place of your parents and execute the family law!"
"The Buddhas say that this form is not life, but if so, how is life in the body?"
"Where did this bone and flesh come from, and how did it live in the womb?"
Alas
Alas!
I had no intention of being your enemy.
But you know nothing about their methods.
"After crossing the Fire Mountain, there is the Ling Mountain. Can you cross it?"
"You're so unadaptable, oh well..."
"All he thinks about is revenge, he doesn't even care about his family."
Spit out your brother's belongings!
"I'm sorry to be late, Your Majesty. You must have suffered a lot."
They...
No one is willing to come...
Madam... that's all...
Two celestial immortals
Please have mercy on me and spare my son's life.
This child is the last trace of the Western Yaksha clan.
The tragic and bizarre circumstances of his birth are rare in the world.
He is now powerless to resist.
If you can give him a chance to live...
"I, the female demon, and the Great Power, are willing to sincerely hide our true nature and sit in meditation to cultivate."
"Along with a pair of children, they will forever reside in the Fire Mountain..."
My husband and I...
I am willing to take the punishment for him!
"If the celestial being does not reject it, this precious fan..."
And here's a gift for you...
"Where there is a scripture, there is fire."
"Where there is no fire, there is no scripture."
"If you don't avenge your enemies, how can you achieve enlightenment?"
What they want to see...
It is precisely now that we are kneeling.
I...
But I won't let you...
Sui Xin!
"Bear, you have a chance to redeem yourself by performing a meritorious deed. I will grant you a pair of eyes."
"Porcupine, you are doing the right thing, take your ears off"
"Huang Mei, you revive your spirits, and keep your nose in check."
"Baiyuan, you have endured and carried the burden, your tongue is under your control."
"Niu Mo, you have shown great loyalty and courage by putting family duty above personal feelings."
His body is yours.
"You old ox, you're really bad luck."
"This whole life, I've never made the right choice once."
"Brother Ox, save some strength."
"We still have to fight our way up to heaven and capture that old guy, the Jade Emperor!"
This guy looks like the leader of the heavenly soldiers.
"Brother Ox, you hold the rear, I'll go and meet him for a while."
"I know you don't want to, but I'm not any better off."
That child...
It was them who forced me to drink the water of the Mother River and give birth to myself.
"If it weren't for that monkey, we could have let all this never happen."
"From now on, we will live apart and enjoy our own peace."
Old fool!
"You knew my background, why did you still want to be their dog?"
I didn't want to cut off ties with you.
"If you still have a shred of filial piety, you should give me that thing."
Let me go back to avenge my kin!
My lord!
"This fan is given to that monkey, and he should go back and leave!"
"You brother, I taught him a lesson."
"Your son, I've given him away."
"Today, I also want to take your wife's fan."
To become a disciple and achieve enlightenment.
"There is only one path left for us to take, and my elder brother still doesn't understand?"
"Monkey Brother, that old ox's wife, was also killed by me with a single blow of my mallet."
"When you take off the clothes, you'll find it's a jade-faced v"
I always thought that accumulating merit would allow me to enter the celestial ranks.
"They will let me go, and they will let you go too."
It turns out that I am such a person.
"Only if I live alone, I am guilty."
"Big brother, take care of your wife and children."
The things I turn into after
"Good nephew, we're returning home, not reincarnating."
"Is that old monkey good or bad? He's waiting on top of Flower Fruit Mountain, so there's no need to rush."
"Let's follow his instructions and bring back the five sticks, and then we'll have all six!"
The dead man of the cat's head
"Look, look"
I knew that old guy must have left out some words.
"Otherwise, how did those gods in the sky come to this village again?"
It's no surprise that it's because of you.
"It's really difficult, it's really difficult!"
"The path is a dead end, and the way of creation is low."
You're a traitor who reports on others.
"I don't mind not finding you, but you dare to come and provoke me."
"If you were to bet, you should have died today."
"Fate, fate!"
It's the cloud of my senior brother!
"I was worried about how to catch you, but this cloud is so slippery."
"Perhaps it is because he has been hiding in this mountainous area for many years, sensing your five roots."
"Remembering your old master, you were saved by chance."
"It recognizes you, so it might as well be put to use first."
"I can transform into wind, but I can't carry your mortal flesh and bones."
"There are so many heavenly soldiers and generals here, there must be something big happening in the mountains, let's go and see."
This...
This is the Master's suit of chainmail armor!
"This monkey is just like the old pig, full of treasures."
"Not only did he not die, but his armor also became a spirit of the mountain."
Still thinking about killing off all the eagles and dogs in the sky and sending them down to join them as companions.
"If we cannot capture them first, they will be stolen by these useless things."
"The old pig will go to look for the other few, you hurry up and follow."
Good! Good! Good!
"With these two tufts of hair, you look even more like a monkey."
Just don't imitate him and act like a bully.
"There are so many monkey treasures, and the old pig will explore around again."
"Get out of the way, this time I'm the one who gets the credit!"
Stop! Stop! Stop!
"With you monkeys around, old pig is always in vain."
"My dear nephew, once you reach great heights in the future, don't forget to bring your uncle along."
"Don't learn from your ancestor, good things never thought of me, dirty work and hard work all take me to the barrel."
"Here's the bill, let's go check out somewhere else."
In! In! In!
"Oh, it hurts! It hurts!"
"My dear nephew, my dear nephew!"
"Please save me, this thing is hard to digest."
"Good nephew, be careful, don't break my heart, liver, spleen, and lungs!"
Is it not working? Quickly hit it with a stick!
"My dear nephew, have you angered it?"
"What's the commotion? My nephew, can you do it?"
"This time, it's my turn to save you again."
"The old pig eats vegetarian food, so it's likely that the inside isn't very dirty."
"Don't be picky, don't be picky."
"Fortunately, you brought this thing back, so it's not too much of a loss."
"Now that my brother's golden armor is all gathered, we should go to the Water Curtain Cave and sit there. Come with me."
"Where are you from, barbarian?"
My troops of monkeys under the command of the Great Sage are all the same appearance.
Your face is various and your appearance is somewhat like a thunder pile. You must be a demon from another place.
"It's been a long time since I've been here since my journey west, and I didn't expect it to still look like this."
"Back then, he was on this mountain, and he made me bow to him."
It's hidden here.
"Sure enough, even the Guanyin said that the monkey was stingy."
This must also be left for the monkey descendants.
"Little nephew, let you try it out."
Taking this thing means there's no turning back.
Your appearance... is exactly the same as your brother's.
My nephew is now fully equipped and armed with a fearsome weapon.
"Hurry up and climb the mountain, let me see what old monkey is up to."
"These ignorant creatures, kill them all!"
"Today, even if it's the Jade Emperor himself, I won't let him take even a single hair!"
"Little celestial soldier, pfft!"
"Go to heaven and ask around, can you afford to mess with the old pig too!"
Make your master come out and challenge the old pig!
"Don't worry about them, they're just a bunch of idiots. My nephew, just go straight up the mountain."
"Damn it, get out of the way!"
Move out of the way for the old pig!
"Patriarch! Here, come over, come over quickly!"
"The old guy said to wait for me on the top of the mountain, but there was not a single person in sight."
"Only left this strange stone standing here, what's the fuss about?"
"This stone, based on my old pig's knowledge, is probably the stone egg that the big brother transformed into."
/
Are you here?
Here we go!
Get on the boat.
"I said, old monkey, once you get on this贼船, you won't be able to turn back."
"Where in the world is not a pirate ship, if you don't get on my ship, do you think you can turn back?"
Where is this place?
His memory
"That monkey has always been like this, he must get his hands on anything good he sees."
"If others don't give, he will take."
This is a bad habit of not choosing means to please oneself.
What's the difference between you and the black bear Jinchi?
"Stealing and petty theft are unacceptable,"
"I think so, it's about the same, it's about the same."
"Good monkey, even in the underground you have become a king and a saint."
I just want to go up to heaven and get a job.
"However, he didn't stay in heaven for long. He was furious when the Queen Mother didn't invite him to the banquet."
I wish I could tear down the entire Heavenly Palace.
"Ears hear, anger arises, and one acts without restraint."
"He's just like that yellow-haired beast, he can't be tamed, he can't be tamed."
"At that time, he was still young and didn't understand much."
"Without the guidance of the Buddha or a master, how could I have learned this?"
"You old man, you're too stingy, always holding onto someone's ugly past."
It's not much better even if it's bigger.
"After he came out from under the Five Fingers Mountain, he said he had learned the proper etiquette and had calmed his mind."
This one pee in the Cheda Kingdom has exposed everything.
"No respect for elders, self-proclaimed idol"
I never took the teachings of the Buddha and my master to heart.
Just a little naughty.
"People with natural talent often have a bit of narcissism in their bones, and so do I."
"Nose sniffing love, eyes empty of everything"
"Compared to that arrogant Yellow Eyebrow boy, I don't think I'm much worse off."
"It's not that someone, what's the lady's name?"
It made the master so angry that he expelled his elder brother back to his hometown.
"In Baihu Ling, he was ruthless and heartless."
"Breaking up with the past lover three times in a row, thinking that there will be no牵挂 from then on."
You also know that he has never let go of his heart.
"Otherwise, I wouldn't have become a Buddha, and I would still insist on escaping from Lingshan."
"Tasting with the tongue is a must, but being too emotional can lead to easy breakage."
"This is something he's like you, and your lovers."
"No matter where you are, you are"
"Don't bother me, old pig is not enough wisdom"
"After that, my brother's love affairs have calmed down a lot."
"Zhu Bajie, take a closer look, there are many of your good friends here."
Drinking and eating together doesn't make you a friend.
Drinking and eating friends are also friends.
"Alright, as you say."
These old brothers... it seems like none of them had a good ending.
"Yes, there have been so many talented and extraordinary individuals throughout history."
But only a few have truly achieved immortality.
Do you know why?
The world is unjust?
The world is never fair.
Bad luck?
Luck is just a humble term for the strong.
That can only be...
I'm not as handsome as the old pig.
Because of having talent but not making progress
"Small wealth is content, addicted to pleasure"
"Want to be comfortable, but also want fame and fortune."
"Want to enjoy the江湖, but also want to become a Buddha or a patriarch"
There's no such thing as a good thing.
"The body is full of worries, how can it be completely sought after?"
Both the Ox Demon King and the Monkey King are like this.
"With the favor of fate, one must also have the resolve to cut off personal desires and ordinary thoughts."
"Remember well, you."
"Old monkey, this can't be the memory of my senior brother, you're playing tricks on us again."
"Now, there is still one missing from the six roots."
"Eighty-two, which one is it?"
"Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind..."
"Intent, lack of intent"
What did you see just now?
We three?
That's the last one.
"I understand, it's you!"
"I've been suspecting it since early on, maybe you're the one who's the big brother's intention."
It's no wonder we've been guided all the way.
"It's not me, it's him."
"What nonsense, you say he's the big brother?"
"Yes, but not really."
"I say, you old monkey, you've come this far, why are you still being so evasive and not getting to the point!"
"After the death of the Great Sage, five of his six roots remained, and were divided among several demon kings."
Only the intention is missing.
"It means the first of the six roots, which is the unique essence of every life."
"For this reason, it is destined to perish with the passing of life."
Wait a minute.
You said that the big brother died and couldn't come back to life?
"You old thing, you've been fooling us all along!"
"Your big brother, there is no way he can come back to life."
But his fundamental principles have not been neglected.
The heavens and earth will surely produce a suitable successor.
"Pass down that root, along with its name, together."
This chosen successor is a divine being.
You were once an unknown person.
"However, on the way to gather the six roots, he fought many fierce battles and overcame great difficulties."
Refining a strong will worthy of that power
Are you saying that this little monkey should replace my senior brother?
Is he qualified?
"Monkey King, you're already dead!"
"Eighty-one, you know in your heart that your brother never had such a complete one."
"Since Sun Wukong is no longer here, the one who takes over this title must be him."
"It's here, we can't go any further, you must go alone."
"After the death of Sun Wukong, a broken and incomplete skeleton with six limbs was left behind."
"Even though many years have passed, the remains still have natural spiritual energy and can sense the breath of its previous life."
"If you are truly destined to be, go and remove this zombie that is neither alive nor dead, without a soul or spirit."
"From now on, the six roots are united, and the Journey to the West is resumed."
"No, no, no!"
"He's always dull and dull, I don't trust him, I'll go with him."
This place is the residue of Monkey King's lingering thoughts after his death.
"This is the final stage of returning to the original, and he has to do it himself."
"We can't help you, you see."
"Little monkey, good nephew, if you can't beat them, run away!"
"Wukong's reputation, we don't need it!"
You must have heard about him.
Some people say that he helped Tang Seng obtain the true scriptures.
"Sealed the Buddha of the Fighting Victory, and has been left in the Ling Shan."
Some people say that the one who became a Buddha was not him.
"The real him, died on the road to the west a long time ago."
Some people even say that the Journey to the West never happened.
He is just a monkey created by a storyteller.
"But the story I'm going to tell you, you've never heard before."
"See what he sees, think what he thinks."
"You've come back here after wandering around, have you gained any insights?"
There is an old friend who has been waiting for you for a long time.
"The time has come, and this last painting is the answer."
"Go away, this story, no one sees it more clearly than him."
"The mountain is cold, and there's not much good wine to be had."
"After going through so much trouble to find me here, I'm sure you're not here to keep me company."
"There must be something you can't get over in your heart, or someone you can't let go of."
I'm the same too.
"I can't kill that monkey, no one can, except for himself."
It was only later that I realized that perhaps that was the only way.
He has no choice.
"I, neither."
Open!
"Little monkey, you really have a bit of his shadow."
"Since it has come to this, I will no longer hold back, I apologize!"
"Today wasn't enough fun, let's go back to heaven and get drunk for three days first, and then fight for three hundred rounds."
The one who can force me to this state is indeed this monkey.
I think of you every day when you're not here.
"Monkey, you haven't used this form yet."
Let's practice with them first.
"Sure enough, it's a good monkey!"
"Since I'm helping you, I'll help you all the way!"
"It's too dull, fighting with you... it's still so difficult to damage the sword."
"This one, I'll be with you!"
"Stone, it has to..."
Hard!
Very good
Now you look very much like me!
"If you have the ability, come and take revenge here!"
It's really hard.
It was him who won.
"I sent my brothers to test you, and this is the moment I've been waiting for."
"After that battle, until today, I finally understand..."
A name that lasts a lifetime cannot lock him in.
A single band cannot restrain him.
"By sacrificing my physical body, I will ensure the eternal continuation of my thoughts."
I hope you won't disappoint him.
"My heart is at peace, and your journey has just begun."
"If he can come out of that painting, what should be said about this fate?"
"I am just a fortune teller, and the fortune tells the fate."
The future is the future because it is uncertain.
The fate of the unknown is beyond the power of heaven to predict.
"Destiny, or cause and effect."
"The cause has been set, and no one can escape the consequences."
"I can't figure it out, I just don't know enough about the cause."
"Hey, there's something that even the master can't figure out in this world."
"Good news, good news!"
"Even if you become a Buddha, what's the point?"
"That band, it's always been on your head."
"Open your dog eyes, I'll take it off and show you!"
"Monkey King, you caused a great disturbance in the heavens."
I used my profound magical power to suppress him under the Five Elements Mountain.
"Fortunately, the disaster was satisfied, and he returned to the Buddhist teachings."
"And rejoice that you hide evil and promote good, and have worked hard to defeat demons and monsters on the way, achieving a complete end."
Promote you to a higher position and grant you the title of the Buddha of Victory in the Fight.
"That fellow has violated heaven, and the Jade Emperor has established these three things."
"Wait until the chicken eats all the rice, the dog licks the face clean, and the lamp burns through the lock."
It should have rained just now.
"Brothers, drink this cup and let's fight our way up to the Heavenly Palace!"
"I have been confined in a cage for a long time, and now I can return to nature."
Have you seen any stray ghosts along the way?
"The essence of the spirit does not dissipate, floating in the air."
"Alas, your gourd is not useful, and my gourd recognizes its master."
"I have a method that can help you transcend the souls of the dead, return to their true form, and be of great assistance to you."
"This is what it should be like. You can't claim to be the sky, but you can save people. Get rid of delusions and enter the cycle of rebirth early."
"Since I have received the divine mandate, I cannot turn back."
"We are all just grass in this vast universe, where can we go?"
"Beauty fades, but it can be preserved with a brush."
"You are already on the road, how can you stop your steps?"
"Just go ahead and do whatever you want, we'll see each other again."
"Everyone knows that being a god is good, but only fame is unforgettable."
Where are the tombs of ancient generals and ministers? They are now just a heap of grass.
"Disperse and chase the wind, this is no longer the same body."
I knew you would come here.
"Destiny is like this, step by step, with cause and effect."
"This place contains a treasure, which is a scale that fell to the human world when the old dragon king of Jinghe was beheaded. Others cannot see it."
"Have you seen anything in this Yellow Wind Ridge, young friend?"
"Once upon a time, the king of the river dragon defied the will of heaven, and the emperor was furious and wanted to impose a joint punishment."
The four rivers and lakes dragon gods were so scared that they hid away.
Gods? What's the difference between gods?
"As long as you are tainted by karma, you are just a dish on the table, a fish in the pond."
"The four rivers and lakes, the dragon gods of the four rivers, their destinies are sealed, and so are ours."
"It's a coincidence, meeting an old friend in the cold, what more could I ask for?"
"Come on, let's all enjoy the snow and recite poetry together."
"Oh, it seems like I won't be able to drink this tea today."
"Don't worry, Monkey Brother"
"Come on, let's sit down first."
"That monster has black hair and a red tail, and has a cunning appearance, so it's not easy to catch."
"You have some superficial cultivation, but this is the extreme north where it is extremely cold and icy."
"Rashly and carelessly, your life is in danger."
"Today, since we have met again by chance, I will teach you a small technique to protect yourself and keep warm."
"I am not an ordinary person, this is not an ordinary fire."
"From now on, no matter if you get hurt, tired, or cold, you can draw a circle on the ground with your stick."
"No matter what kind of tiger, leopard, wolf, or insect, demon, or ghost, he dares not approach."
"But if you understand the fun of playing the piano, you don't need to worry about the sound of the strings."
"Love and affection are just like white clouds and white dogs, and they will eventually be covered with spider webs and return to nothingness."
"Monkey brothers, broken mirrors cannot be reunited."
You can go and talk to that pig elder and warn him not to get too involved.
"Originally a celestial maiden, she fell from the heavens in pursuit of desire."
I have been trapped in this cave for a year.
"How can I be called by you, and I will drink a muddy wine to soothe myself."
Good wine deserves a good vessel.
"This, take it!"
"Niu Mang accepted his fate, but someone didn't want to accept it."
"A clear official cannot decide family matters, so why should we get involved?"
Drink a good cup of wine and forget all your worries and sorrows.
"Without a cause, why is my head hanging in the market square?"
"Without a cause, why has the four rivers lost their management?"
"Without cause, why are all colors confused?"
"Without cause, why is compassion turned upside down?"
"Without any reason, why is the red-bearded man hiding in the forest?"
"This is called: wood produces smoke, mist grows thunder and lightning, singing behind the back, the true intention is revealed."
"Without a cause, why is the sand covering the Li's hair?"
"This is called: the sound of waves, the remnants of the old, hiding in defense, and cleverly creating a door."
"Without a cause, why is the green back submerged on the shore?"
"This is called: Evening shadows, sword tracks, everything clear, electric light, morning dew, gathering and dispersing, separation and reunion."
"Without any reason, why is the temple hidden in yellow clothes?"
"This is called: fine dust clinging to clothes, swirling in the air and falling to the ground, leaving one feeling empty and tired, with a sense of loss and weariness."
"The fortune-teller Mr. Yuan is a master of divination, but he certainly did not expect..."
I transformed into a pattern and hid within him...
"My father died to fulfill the mission of the Journey to the West, and we have not forgotten to avenge him every day."
Yet there was not a single day when he was not homeless and without a place to stay.
"Without you, I can end the cause and effect."
My father defied the king's decree and had his head displayed in the market square.
We fear that the Jade Emperor will be angry and ask for your help to escape from the Four Seas.
"However, Mr. Yuan said, one can hide for a while, but not forever."
"Eventually, someone will come to take our lives."
The gentleman also said that sacrificing oneself for the sake of righteousness is the destiny of our race generation after generation.
"I believe, but I don't recognize."
I hope your life is not just another sacrifice for the old gods.
Your three brothers have all been defeated.
Why wait any longer to meet?
"Fate comes and goes, why not take another gamble..."
"What should I do, what should I do?"
"Come here, don't be afraid, my brother was born from a high-ranking family and won't easily eat people."
"Your Majesty, it seems you are not from these parts. Are you also here to pay homage to the Black Wind King?"
"Listen to me, this black bear is strong on the outside but weak on the inside, and it can't be trusted."
It's better for you to leave this place as soon as possible.
"Raising the dead and bringing back life, gold and silver, are all just tricks. Those little demons were all fooled."
"The Black Wind Demon is good at tricks, pretending to cultivate and nurture, but secretly greedy and deceitful. I dare not entrust my affairs to him."
"Although I don't know why you are here, you must be careful."
"I am in a hurry now, I need to leave immediately, goodbye for now."
"Grandpa mice, I really came to see your big king!"
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I came to pay my respects to your great king!"
"How did you end up here, my lord?"
Hurry up! Hurry up! I don't need your help!
"Your Highness, we have a very close connection. It's amazing that we met again at the Yellow Wind Ridge after parting at the Black Wind Mountain."
"These rats don't know the difference between good and bad, and they tied me up directly."
"Jokingly, he said to send it to Wuhu Temple, and then pickle it and send it to the king."
All the monsters here are hungry ghosts.
"However, rest assured, it won't be easy to eat your horse."
"This Yellow Wind Ridge has cats and mice sleeping together, causing chaos."
"The Yellow Wind Saint did not pay attention to it, strange, strange!"
Who dares to pay homage to such a great king?
"I advise you to flee for your life, this place is not suitable for staying for a long time."
"Go ahead, you can't do anything to me, little mouse demon."
I have my own way to escape.
"Although your body is thin, you won't escape being eaten by this group of hungry ghosts."
Let's escape quickly.
"I have unfinished business, so I will take advantage of the opportunity to escape."
"This place is full of nosy people, but if we have a chance, we will meet again."
Old friend!
"Yellow Eyebrow Buddha, do you know why we have come?"
"When I came to this Little West Heaven and paid my respects to the Buddha, I realized that I had wasted my life for others and missed out on many joys."
I'm not going anymore...
"Although the king of the house is in trouble, can all good and bad things in the world be self-inflicted?"
